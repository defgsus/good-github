Welcome to the RedCarpet internship Bootcamp
**WARNING: This is a hard time-limited program. Your performance in this program will decide the projects
assigned to you. There are no exceptions. **
If you screw up the Bootcamp, it is very likely that you wont be able to deal with the level of sophistication
and complexity that our production code will demand.
The bootcamp is designed to achieve 3 goals:
1. Eliminate fear of reading code - writing code is very easy. Reading code is very hard. The best programmers
in the world can read code fast ...not write it (like Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat at Google
(https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge)) We will fix this
by working on different programming languages and frameworks for everyone ... even if that is not your
main project area. Meaning - you will work on Android/Kotlin, Javascript/Reactjs, Postgresql/SQL and
(Python/Flask or Python/Pandas).
2. Learning to debate/disagree and align/commit with colleagues is a first order skill. You will write a Memo
(https://slab.com/blog/jeff-bezos-writing-management-strategy/) on a topic and present it (by speaking) to
your mentor in person.
3. Consistency - we will achieve hard standards of code consistency. Including expectation of IDE setup, git
pull requests, etc.
4. Strong career achievement - The best companies in the world prefer an Achievement data
(https://www.businessinsider.in/A-head-recruiter-at-Amazon-says-the-best-resumes-are-data-based-and-
theres-an-easy-formula-you-can-follow/articleshow/65235908.cms) based criteria for selecting candidates
for jobs. Your college just gives you rote skills. You will build your achievements here.
Work culture at RedCarpet:
Ownership - If you are given a task (which might be as trivial as sending an email), make sure you do it... or
you come and tell us that you were not able to do it. Dont silently ignore it. You are now a valuable member
of one of the most disruptive startups in India. Take responsibility.
Hands on & Low Ego - As founders, we have still swept floors and cleaned generators using mop cloths.
Anything from writing testcases to making phone calls is [your job]. Make it happen. We dont believe in
caste system around work.
Jugaad - we encourage jugaad. Dont make things more complex than they need to be, just because they
sound cool.
Be a [Honeybadger] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvlalDNxccw) - Never give up. (P.S. check out
videos of honeybadgers on youtube!)
Design for Honesty - The design culture at RedCarpet is "Design for Honesty"
(https://www.redcarpetup.com/2017/11/29/design-for-honesty/). Make sure you read about that.
Two Laws of Software Engineering: At RedCarpet we believe in two sacrosanct laws of software engineering.
These can never be violated. Make sure you memorize these.
1. "It is much harder to read code than to write it" - Anyone can write code. Very few can read code. The
popular opinion is that "Creating a new software project is the impactful work. Fixing bugs is boring". The
reality is that - fixing bugs is not boring. It is much harder since you need to read existing code and

understand it. A hundred monkeys can write the code that you can. But only a great engineer can read
code. It is very easy to write code/proposals/designs. It is very hard to read someone else's
code/proposals/designs. At RedCarpet we recognize that a lot of poor decisions that are made is because
of this problem.
Corollary - The more code you read, the better engineer you become. Read a lot of code on Github.
Make it easy to read code. Write testcases.
2. "Premature complexity is the root of all evil" - Only write as much code as is required to solve the problem.
Dont build something extra to make it look "cooler". Dont use Tensorflow if a python script is sufficient.
Corollary - never tell us "I have written the code, but not run it". If you have written one line/function of
code, you better have run it.
How to Follow this guide - this guide is split into multiple tracks. There are specific mentors for each track. It is
your responsibility to approach them. Important note - wherever it is mentioned that "show this to your mentor", it
means you have to show completion of that particular line item to your mentor. Remember it is [your]
responsibility to call them and show them [as soon as] you have successfully completed that task. This is not like
college where we will call you for assignment submission.
[For each and every tutorial that you do, show WORKING CODE. Even if it is a language tutorial. Do not
just watch a tutorial. If we ask you to show the code and then cannot produce it, we will ask you to redo
the tutorial again. The code must be in running form in an IDE/script (not in notepad or a word document) ]
IMPORTANT: Make sure you have a printout of this guide. Get a signature from mentor on EVERY SINGLE
point in the guide.
Failure to submit (even if you have completed it) will be taken as a negative point.
What is a "Bezos style" Memo? Being able to write and express your thoughts is a first-order skill at RedCarpet.
We are inspired by the thoughtfullness that Jeff Bezos put in the notes that made Amazon the most valuable
company on earth. NOTE: Memo questions need to be done at home and not in the office
*We don't do PowerPoint (or any other slide-oriented) presentations at Amazon.
Instead, we write narratively structured six-page memos. We silently read one at the
beginning of each meeting in a kind of "study hall." Not surprisingly, the quality of
these memos varies widely. *
Here's what we've figured out - great memos are written and re-written, shared with
colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and
then edited again with a fresh mind. They simply can't be done in a day or two. The
key point here is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching
scope -- that a great memo probably should take a week or more.
A memo has five rules:
1. You cant use "points" or "bullets". You have to explain in paragraph and in words. Even things like data and
numbers must be explained in words.
2. No graphs or tables
3. Must have elaborate appendix - which can have tables, graphs and other references. This is mandatory.
However, you should write a memo with expectation that most people will not look through this section.
4. The title must have a very well defined goal. It cant be vague - You will cover the Why, What, When, Who
and How of achieving the goal in the memo.

Preparation for the training program As mentioned in the Offer letter, there are some recommended
requirements for the internship:
1. Operating System - Windows 8 is NOT ALLOWED. There are too many problems with packages. Windows
10, Mac OSX and Linux are all allowed. (We recommend Linux)
2. Hardware - The most important change you can make to your laptop is to get a SSD (Solid State Hard
Drive). It will boost your performance 10X more than a CPU/RAM. We HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND you
buy a 250 GB Kingson SSD (https://www.amazon.in/Kingston-SSDNow-Internal-SA400S37-
240GIN/dp/B079TH8YZQ) (2,500 INR) or Crucial MX500 series (https://www.amazon.in/Crucial-MX500-
500GB-2-5-inch-SSD/dp/B0786QNS9B) (500 GB for 5500 INR). It can mean the difference between a
highly successful internship and being on the bottom tier. Remember that you cannot use this as an external
disk - you need to replace your main hard drive and reinstall your operating system. (You can order from
amazon and get someone from Urbanclap to install the SSD + operating system within a few hours).
3. Security key setup - you may be given a security key later. this is how you set it up.

(https://gist.github.com/sandys/3af5a5f26b7a3b8f28dcdbf4092876e0)
4. Wifi setup - we use 5ghz enterprise grade wifi using Ubiquiti. Some older laptops dont work properly with
this setup. If you have a laptop older than TWO years, then please buy a dual band USB wifi adapter
(with 5ghz support). One example is this (https://www.amazon.in/TP-Link-Archer-T2U-Wireless-
Adapter/dp/B07KRCW6LZ). P.S. Please ensure it works with your laptop and OS. Choose the one that you
prefer.

Back out of weak-only ETags

Reasoning:
1) Fuck the spec, it clashes with CSP and that's not my fault
2) Rotating a nonce token *technically* should change the strong
   `ETag`, since the page content is changing.
3) Compounding this, the *supposed* meaning of a *weak* `ETag`,
   is _conceptual_ equality between two resource versions. Which
   makes sense for this use case!
4) However, weak-`ETag` values imply that content _changes_
   byte-for-byte, however, is not semantically identical.
5) But rotating nonces don't change the semantics of content!

So, I'm leaving it how it is, spec be damned. I suppose the nonce
doesn't matter anyway if you receive a `304` for your request.

Revamp door_vault

This is one of the great spoiler vaults that we allow to remain in the
game, but the vault could use some improvements. Expand its placement a
little to include D:13-14 instead of just D:$. Subsequent commits will
reduce the number of spoilers it does have by giving it and its
look-alike variants the same placement, for the most part. That way, no
matter where you open door vault, you may discover an 8 and 9 spawn zoo,
a hellephant zoo, or just a room full of lovely butterflies!

Tweak the monster sets to have uniformly difficult branch-specific
monsters together with end-level branch spawns at somewhat higher
weight. Before this change, the monster lists had individual weaker
monsters in addition to a high-weight normal branch spawn entry, which
is redundant. I've also made the nasty spawns more memorable, with
attention given to the top-tier branch-unique monsters.

Finally, this commit adds a common setup function for all door vault
variants to set loot and door markers and glyphs. Door vault was
notorious for not placing loot, making it purely an exercise in XP gain.
The addition of on-average 8 good items makes the decision to open a
door vault feel less silly.

Revamp not_door_vault_due

This "elephant" door vault variant placed normal and dire elephants, but
notably placed a single hellephant. Unfortunately, non-demonic elephants
are not challenging through the range of this vault's placement, and a
single hellephant does make up for this. So rather than leaving this as
an easier door vault variant, I've revamped the monster set to focus on
its hellish and demonic themes. I've also brought its level placement in
line with the other door vault variants to reduce spoilers.

The new monster set includes hell hogs and hell hounds for Dungeon, a
chaotic theme for Elf and Zot, and a mix of hell knights, hellions and
balrugs for other branches. At least one hellephant is always present,
and additional ones are added, scaling with depth of placement, up to 4
guaranteed hellephants in Geh and Dis.

As I've done for the other door vault variants, the common setup
function is used, which adds appropriate loot. There is also now a
version of this vault for the Vaults branch.

flip them to better match Fortran. I'm tired of that language
  * Dimensions are flipped (so we sync with the first, second and third

net: sctp: fix ipv6 ipsec encryption bug in sctp_v6_xmit

[ Upstream commit 95ee62083cb6453e056562d91f597552021e6ae7 ]

Alan Chester reported an issue with IPv6 on SCTP that IPsec traffic is not
being encrypted, whereas on IPv4 it is. Setting up an AH + ESP transport
does not seem to have the desired effect:

SCTP + IPv4:

  22:14:20.809645 IP (tos 0x2,ECT(0), ttl 64, id 0, offset 0, flags [DF], proto AH (51), length 116)
    192.168.0.2 > 192.168.0.5: AH(spi=0x00000042,sumlen=16,seq=0x1): ESP(spi=0x00000044,seq=0x1), length 72
  22:14:20.813270 IP (tos 0x2,ECT(0), ttl 64, id 0, offset 0, flags [DF], proto AH (51), length 340)
    192.168.0.5 > 192.168.0.2: AH(spi=0x00000043,sumlen=16,seq=0x1):

SCTP + IPv6:

  22:31:19.215029 IP6 (class 0x02, hlim 64, next-header SCTP (132) payload length: 364)
    fe80::222:15ff:fe87:7fc.3333 > fe80::92e6:baff:fe0d:5a54.36767: sctp
    1) [INIT ACK] [init tag: 747759530] [rwnd: 62464] [OS: 10] [MIS: 10]

Moreover, Alan says:

  This problem was seen with both Racoon and Racoon2. Other people have seen
  this with OpenSwan. When IPsec is configured to encrypt all upper layer
  protocols the SCTP connection does not initialize. After using Wireshark to
  follow packets, this is because the SCTP packet leaves Box A unencrypted and
  Box B believes all upper layer protocols are to be encrypted so it drops
  this packet, causing the SCTP connection to fail to initialize. When IPsec
  is configured to encrypt just SCTP, the SCTP packets are observed unencrypted.

In fact, using `socat sctp6-listen:3333 -` on one end and transferring "plaintext"
string on the other end, results in cleartext on the wire where SCTP eventually
does not report any errors, thus in the latter case that Alan reports, the
non-paranoid user might think he's communicating over an encrypted transport on
SCTP although he's not (tcpdump ... -X):

  ...
  0x0030: 5d70 8e1a 0003 001a 177d eb6c 0000 0000  ]p.......}.l....
  0x0040: 0000 0000 706c 6169 6e74 6578 740a 0000  ....plaintext...

Only in /proc/net/xfrm_stat we can see XfrmInTmplMismatch increasing on the
receiver side. Initial follow-up analysis from Alan's bug report was done by
Alexey Dobriyan. Also thanks to Vlad Yasevich for feedback on this.

SCTP has its own implementation of sctp_v6_xmit() not calling inet6_csk_xmit().
This has the implication that it probably never really got updated along with
changes in inet6_csk_xmit() and therefore does not seem to invoke xfrm handlers.

SCTP's IPv4 xmit however, properly calls ip_queue_xmit() to do the work. Since
a call to inet6_csk_xmit() would solve this problem, but result in unecessary
route lookups, let us just use the cached flowi6 instead that we got through
sctp_v6_get_dst(). Since all SCTP packets are being sent through sctp_packet_transmit(),
we do the route lookup / flow caching in sctp_transport_route(), hold it in
tp->dst and skb_dst_set() right after that. If we would alter fl6->daddr in
sctp_v6_xmit() to np->opt->srcrt, we possibly could run into the same effect
of not having xfrm layer pick it up, hence, use fl6_update_dst() in sctp_v6_get_dst()
instead to get the correct source routed dst entry, which we assign to the skb.

Also source address routing example from 625034113 ("sctp: fix sctp to work with
ipv6 source address routing") still works with this patch! Nevertheless, in RFC5095
it is actually 'recommended' to not use that anyway due to traffic amplification [1].
So it seems we're not supposed to do that anyway in sctp_v6_xmit(). Moreover, if
we overwrite the flow destination here, the lower IPv6 layer will be unable to
put the correct destination address into IP header, as routing header is added in
ipv6_push_nfrag_opts() but then probably with wrong final destination. Things aside,
result of this patch is that we do not have any XfrmInTmplMismatch increase plus on
the wire with this patch it now looks like:

SCTP + IPv6:

  08:17:47.074080 IP6 2620:52:0:102f:7a2b:cbff:fe27:1b0a > 2620:52:0:102f:213:72ff:fe32:7eba:
    AH(spi=0x00005fb4,seq=0x1): ESP(spi=0x00005fb5,seq=0x1), length 72
  08:17:47.074264 IP6 2620:52:0:102f:213:72ff:fe32:7eba > 2620:52:0:102f:7a2b:cbff:fe27:1b0a:
    AH(spi=0x00003d54,seq=0x1): ESP(spi=0x00003d55,seq=0x1), length 296

This fixes Kernel Bugzilla 24412. This security issue seems to be present since
2.6.18 kernels. Lets just hope some big passive adversary in the wild didn't have
its fun with that. lksctp-tools IPv6 regression test suite passes as well with
this patch.

IB/ipath: Convert ipath_user_sdma_pin_pages() to use get_user_pages_fast()

commit 4adcf7fb6783e354aab38824d803fa8c4f8e8a27 upstream.

ipath_user_sdma_queue_pkts() gets called with mmap_sem held for
writing.  Except for get_user_pages() deep down in
ipath_user_sdma_pin_pages() we don't seem to need mmap_sem at all.

Even more interestingly the function ipath_user_sdma_queue_pkts() (and
also ipath_user_sdma_coalesce() called somewhat later) call
copy_from_user() which can hit a page fault and we deadlock on trying
to get mmap_sem when handling that fault.  So just make
ipath_user_sdma_pin_pages() use get_user_pages_fast() and leave
mmap_sem locking for mm.

This deadlock has actually been observed in the wild when the node
is under memory pressure.

finishing out the upvote feature

So making a list of usernames on a post that liked it and checking that to enforce no-double-upvoting is pretty sketch, I won't lie. I'm not a big database guy so I didn't remember the "right" way to do that off the top of my head and Doom Eternal was about to come out so I just slapped that together and called it a day. I'll make a bug for it so we don't forget to fix that. I _think_ the correct way to do that is to make a join table (or a relationship table? I don't remember the term) where we map users -> upvoted posts, and then we can search that for our userid (NOT USERNAME -- never forget PSN and the original sin of using names for everything!) and check if this post id is in that list.

Actually, typing that solution out, it sounds right. I'll drop a note in the bug.

- made the upvote button only work for logged in users
- added upvote information to the posts page on load
- cleaned up frontend script

# Tuesday
On Monday someone asked my advice about freelancing and I told him that
everything good that had happened to me in buisness could be traced back
to meeting someone at an event so he should be going to events of any
type regularly. I then had to admit that I’d hardly left the house for a
couple of years because I absolutely hated the idea of networking.

I was shamed by that so this morning I picked a interesting looking (and
free) event off eventbright and wandered in.

It was run by a man who I had never heard of but who turned out to be a
guru of some sort. People in the audience had been going to his events
for 20 years and he preached a gospel that while massively different
from a lot of what I believe, was a least fun and well delivered; and I
had a whale of a time chatting to various people afterwards (I
networked!) and got some new perspectives on things and clarified
thoughts I’d been on the edge of having for years.

That was good. Also: turns out there is a university in the middle of
Regent’s Park. That was news to me.

In need of some significant introvert time I then headed over for a
cinema trip with a friend- we saw 1917 and I sobbed during at least five
separate parts. Exhausting. Awesome film. Really something: a real slap
in the face in a ‘you think you have problems’ way. There was also
flapjack and salad that had questionable legal status.

One catch up with a close friend turned into another when one sprang
into view at Euston station. A proper validating and fun conversation
later, I went to a support group, which was cool, although not how I
remembered it, and I wanted to tell you that because it’s the sort of
thing I want people to be able to tell other people.

ObjCThemis: Secure Cell API update (#606)

* Update Secure Cell API: Seal mode

Start preparing Secure Cell to passphrase API introduction by updating
encryption/decryption API. It is not directly related to passphrases,
but since we're going to reeducate users about Secure Cell, it's a good
point to improve the API.

One annoyance with (all) Secure Cell APIs is how they are mapped into
Swift. This is somewhat asymmetrical mapping: wrap and unwrapData,
because of some Swift renaming magic. This naming scheme is also
inconsistent with every other Themis wrapper on desktop systems which
all use encrypt end decrypt.

Update the API to use "encrypt" and "decrypt" naming scheme. Also,
provide more overloads for Objective-C to omit optional arguments.
Note that we have to hide some API from Swift in order to get better
error handling conversion. We need to expose only methods with explicit
NSError out-parameters.

The old API is declated deprecated from now on. It is implemented via
the new API as a compatibility shim.

While we're here, take this chance to improve inline API docs which make
for a better IDE experience.

* Update Secure Cell API: Context Imprint mode

Context Imprint mode needs the same consistency updates as Seal mode.
However, things are much easier because associated context is not
optional in this mode.

If there is anything interesting, note that it's no longer necessary to
explicitly spell out __autoreleasing for NSError out parameters. Modern
Objective-C compilers are able to infer this annotation.

* Update Secure Cell API: Token Protect mode

Token Protect mode is the one which gets most updates. Along with the
same API renaming as other modes, there are two important changes:

- decryption API now accepts message and token separately
- encryption API returns a new helper object

Previous decryption API accepts input via TSCellTokenEncryptedData
objects -- the same ones as returned by encryption API. While this
makes it easy to write unit tests, in real usage mesage and token
are retrieved separately. Constructing an intermediate
TSCellTokenEncryptedData object is completely unnecessary.
New API rectifies this issue.

Encryption API returns a new helper object TSCellTokenEncryptedResult
which is almost idential to TSCellTokenEncryptedData, but uses NSData
instead of NSMutableData. This allows for better Swift experience as
it's directly bridged with Data, without any NSMutableData casts.

TSCellTokenEncryptedResult also uses a different name for encrypted
message, consistent with documentation and Android API. The old name
is accessible to make it easier to port existing code that might
operate on TSCellTokenEncryptedData instances.

* Update Secure Cell tests: Objective-C

Overhaul Secure Cell test suite to improve coverage and debuggability.
Giant testing methods are split into multiple individual tests for each
subsystem separately.

* Update Secure Cell tests: Swift

Well, this is simply a rewrite of Objective-C test suite into Swift.

* Update Secure Cell class API docs

Clean up and update Secure Cell class documentation too. Modern Xcode
does not support HeaderDoc format anymore so keep it simple. Update
wording in some places for better style. Add links to documentation
where users can read more about Secure Cell modes.

base: Set scrollview on the power menu

So why? Because fuck you that's why...

No, you need this for if and when we decide to add more items to the power menu and the
density is too high. Previously if you had more than 5 items, it would cut you off. So
you either had to decide which 5 items you wanted or deal with the jank. That's no longer
the case.

- Added a landscape view so we can set a horizontal scrollview

- Made the power menu dialog all one color. Josh and I talked about this and I previously
made the case to keep it the same but after thinking it over, it looks better all one color.

"1:45pm. Done with breakfast. Let me do the chores and then I will resume my fight to get the Ocaml tooling working.

2:15pm. I am done. Let me finally resume. I'll leave my pleasures behind in order to do some research.

Ok, first of all. Can I use opam directly from Windows?

The reason why I need a Cygwin shell is because the Ocaml compiler uses Linux tools. So the answer would probably be no.

Still, let me just check what happens when I run it. After that I'll see how I can get the shell to start properly.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9637601/open-cygwin-at-a-specific-folder

2:30pm. That thing is to add a launch icon during right click. I have a different problem, namely that the Ocaml files do not work properly when I start in anything but the home folder.

...Ah, let me just ask.

2:50pm. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60775511/how-to-stop-the-cygwin-terminal-from-forgetting-the-environment-when-opening-it

Finally, composed this.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23666173/opening-files-from-cygwin-home-in-windows-applications
"You can also install a Cygwin version of Emacs"

I can? That will make it a lot easier to set up.

3pm. https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2018/cmsc330/ocamlInstallationGuide.pdf

I had not realized it at first, but this guide is a WSL guide.

If I backtrack and go down this route, will that make tooling integration easier? Will I be able to use the Ocaml tools directly? I do not really understand the pros and cons of WSL at the moment.

3:35pm. Damn, how time consuming this is. Enough Reddit posting. I'll see if I get any good replies by the end of the day. I did get a good hint by that guy who told me the `reason-vscode` plugin supports both Reason and Ocaml.

If I do not get anything more, I'll just ask the author for advice.

For now, let me resume reading the documentation. In the worst case, I'll just use Emacs for Cygwin in order to get Ocaml to work.

3:45pm. Let me resume the documentation. I forgot, where was I before?

```
a(one, two, three)
```

Is the same as...

```
one->a(two, three)
```

Uf, this definitely is not the usual pipe operator behavior like in F#.

Ah, it does seem that `|>` exists and does what I would expect. This here is a special JS thing for objects because JS methods are the wrong way around.

3:55pm. "A variant's constructors, like Some or Student, look like functions, but unfortunately aren't, due to historical reasons. Sometime, it'd still be nice to be able to use them as functions. Pipe First takes the occasion to enable that for you!"

In Ocaml they aren't constructors? That is interesting.

4pm. "The principle of least power applies when you're trying to "Get Things Done". If the problem domain allows, definitely pick the least abstract (aka, the most concrete) solution available, so that the solution is reached faster and has fewer unstable indirections you'd have to traverse. For example, prefer types over free-form data, prefer data-driven configuration over turing-complete function calls, prefer function calls over macros, prefer macros over project forks, etc. When you constrain your domain and power, things become easier to analyze. That is, if the domain is constrained enough to allow it."

The documentation says good things. Incidentally, Haskell violates this constantly.

"Sometimes, it's fine to write a little bit of boilerplate to reduce the need for otherwise extra powerful types. If anything, tasteful tradeoffs might show your pragmatism and judgement more than fancy types!"

This is true too.

4:05pm. Now I am looking the VS Code plugin again.

"This project implements the Language Server Protocol for Reason.

It is written in Reason, and compiled w/ esy + dune. The goal is for it to work equally well on Windows, MacOS, and Linux."

"(but not under WSL, make sure you install bs-platform etc. from the windows side)"

I am not sure that the project supports Ocaml after all.

But I find it interesting that it is written in Reason itself. That is some good info on me. It will make studying it easier.

4:10pm. Well, forget that. Let me resume the Reason documentation. I'll aim to finish it all today.

This stuff is easy and I am completely familiar with it.

4:30pm. https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/exception

"The above tip seems to contradict what's happening in the OCaml standard library; prominent functions in modules such as List and String seems to throw exceptions overly often. This is partially a historical sediment, and partially out of extreme care for performance. Native OCaml/Reason is incredibly performant; exception throwing was designed to be very cheap, cheaper than allocating and returning e.g. an option. This is unfortunately not the case for JavaScript."

The same goes for F# as well. I remember Jon Harrop talking about how expensive .NET exceptions are compared to Ocaml.

At any rate, a thought occurs to me. What if the ReasonML plugin is not using the compiler itself to do type inference? That might be doable in some cases.

Well, it is probably not the case here, but I should leave my mind open.

4:50pm. https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/module

The stuff here is a pretty good explanation of modules. I actually hadn't known how they work till now.

I admit, the way objects work is fairly bizarre and I hadn't understood the difference between open and closed ones or what that `as 'a` is supposed to represent.

5:05pm. This was interesting. This documentation is good. I finally understand what modules are.

And finally done with the basics section. I'll finish the whole documentation soon.

5:10pm. https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/interop

The way Bucklescript does interop is similar to how I will do it in JS.

By the way...Jon Harrop talked about modules being super complex in the various SML implementations, but from what I've seen, they aren't a big deal.

5:30pm. https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/converting-from-js

I'll really focus on this for later.

https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/native

Let me just take a moment to pause for a bit and catch my breath.

The reason why I am going for ReasonML is because I am actually going to use it. I am seriously considering replacing large parts of `vscode-languageserver-node`, but even though I said that, doing it in either TS or Purescript does not appeal to me. In Reason, I should do it in a proper style.

Now let me get back to the docs.

"Bsb-native is a fork of BuckleScript's bsb that compiles to native OCaml instead."

Why not just use Ocaml then?

...Well, besides the Windows issues?

"Note: Make sure you have the latest esy installed. If in doubt, run npm remove -g esy && npm install -g esy@latest."

I actually did not know about `npm remove`. I was using `uninstall` previously.

"To add native Reason packages that happen to be hosted on npm, run esy add npm-package-name."

This is pretty interesting. Could I do the same for Spiral packages eventually. The stuff Purescript does is interesting, but I want to take the line of least resistance when it comes to doing package management for my own language.

"esy treats the npm scope @opam specially. esy will install any package name with the @opam scope directly from opam. This is the only scope with special meaning. All other package names are assumed to be hosted on npm."

So I can use `opam` using `esy`?

5:40pm. https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/project-structure

Just this thing and then I am done, possibly for the day.

After I finish, my priority will be to check out the Reason plugin. Today I put some effort into Ocaml interop, but now that I know it is entirely written in Reason, I do not have to hesitate in checking it out.

5:55pm. Done with the Reason documentation.

I'll call it a day here.

Still haven't gotten a reply to that SO question. "
