Split Invent into three tags

All this started when someone on Discord noticed that Import Inventory
does not actually import changes, only additions and removals. However,
its documentation clearly stated that it would patch 'additions, changes
and removals'. So I took the opportunity to add that to PBash - but to
preserve backwards compatibility, I obviously couldn't change the
behavior of Invent.

So I decided to split the tag into three tags (Invent.Add, Invent.Change
and Invent.Remove) and introduce an alias that interprets the old Invent
tag as Invent.Add + Invent.Remove whenever it finds it in descriptions,
LOOT tags and BashTags files. I also updated CBash to use the new tags,
but didn't bother to try and make it understand Invent.Change. So CBash
behaves exactly like before. One ugly wart here is the local imports in
mods_metadata.py, but that file might as well be _mods_metadata.py for
all the rethinking it deserves :P

This introduces a framework to allow us to easily support indefinite
backwards-compatibility aliases for Bash Tags, so I went ahead and
refactored the old InventOnly and C.GridFlags tag to use this system.
Also documented all removed and deprecated tags in the Advanced Readme.

An eventual goal here is to investigate if we can refactor this new
implementation of Import Inventory to create an abstract _AMerger, then
rename _SimpleImporter to _APreserver and split importers.py into
_cbash_importer.py, mergers.py and preservers.py.

Note the addition of MelObject.__hash__, noticed way too late that my
set lookups wouldn't work. It's a bit hacky, but at least now any other
set usages of MelObject that might be hiding in the patchers won't break
anymore. Also dropped the weird 'removable' logic in there, was broken
at first but after fixing it it became a noop.

Under #312

Level Improvements

Level improvements to Bonus Island III. This is part of my project to make all Bonus Islands have possible perfect objectives.

- Big Tux can now get to the secret in "Cave Run" where previously he would hit his head.
- "You can't Climb Higher than the Clouds" fixed unrealistic level target time.
- Enemy fixes in "Another Cold Day" stopping enemies from killing themselves.
- Lantern position fixed in "Cold Cavern" as well as 1 bad enemy placement at the end.
- Fixed unrealistic Target times for "Crystal Sunset", " Crystal Fields", "The Dark Castle" and the other "The Dark Castle", "Deep, deeper...", "...deepest!", "Circles", "Entering the castle", "After the Glaciers", "Snowfall alert", "My Penny is over the ocean", "To rain or not to rain..." (both variants), and "Under the Ice".
- Fixed the snowball that killed itself via enemy cramming in "Out on the Crystal Fields"
- Sleeping spiky replaced with igel due to the spiky being woken up by spawning in anyway, and it just falls off and kills itself... Also removed a fireball which killed you within a second of spawning in the level "The Dark Castle" (Forest variant) which is just unfair.
- Added light fade in scripts to "The Dark Castle" (Antarctic variant) because the old scripts were sudden, and were very sore. Also fixed a visual inconsistency.
- Added a target time for "Circles" and also moved the Power-Up due to it blocking the way forcing the player to swap power-ups.
- "Don't Miss your ride" Adjusted the end to make it less annoying to get to the secret using the spring.
- "Going Down" Stopped enemies from killing themselves inside their chambers, also fixed the coins during the descent as some were extremely difficult to get all in one go (you need to collect all coins in one go to get the perfect coin objective).
- "Entering the castle" fixed a basic visual bug with the spikes underwater.
- Fixed the scripts in "Flower Bonus".
- "After the Glaciers" Fixed the rotation and position of sleeping spikys,  due to the jump over it being very tough and killing the spiky without taking damage having a small window of timing.
- Fixed the secret requiring a damage boost in "In the Spring".
- Fixed the awkward secret in "Some light in the darkness would be fine, Thanks!" (inconsistency with the green spikes, the top could be stood on but the sides were dangerous).
- Visual inconsistencies in "Snowfall alert" have been fixed with the spikes.
- Removed the spikes at the bottom of "Holes, a day on Ice" due to enemies dying off-screen and making a lot of noise throughout the entire level, making it very annoying and painful to play.
- Fixed impossible secret and soft-locking platforms in the second sector of "The Toilette zone". Also removed the secret that also acted as a shortcut due to it hindering perfect completion.. not making it impossible but just a lot more annoying.
- "My Penny is over the ocean" snowball enemy replaced with pink snow.
- Removed the zeekling, wisp, some coins, and reworking the platform node to be less obnoxious in "Red Alert! The forest is burning!" Also removed a couple springs in the secret to allow all coins to be easily collected instead of doing awkward duck jumps.
- Made the roof in "Sewer escape" just a bit higher since coyote time was removed, so the jumps from those ledges are very hard and very punishing.
- Made some changes to how you get on the secret elevator in "Three Frosty Icebergs" due to tux being crushed in rare occasions. Also edited a visual bug at the goal.
- Removed an impossible sleeping spiky in "Under the Ice". Also adjusted the ceiling height in the underground section to allow for a jump to be possible as Big Tux.
