Add files via upload

This is version 2.0. 

Now you can multiply, add, subtract, and divide. It's better put in the screen and has some minor improvements in functionality that are not worth mentioning. 

I still hope this is not the final product because it's not nice, and I would never use this as my main calculator. Actually, I don't even think a man in the 1950's with his huge ass calculator would prefer to use this calculator, but it was a fun experience on tkinter.
