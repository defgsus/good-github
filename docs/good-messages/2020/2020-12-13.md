In navigation layer, Bind J/K to scroll up/down in Info-mode

Spacemacs lacks a keybinding alternative to the most natural way of scrolling
Info pages (i.e. SPC) in vanilla emacs.
Anyway, this commit adds J/K to scroll most naturally through info pages.
Currently, in Info-mode, a keybinding for J is not defined while K is bound to
evil-lookup.

Issue #2828 already adresses the inconsistent experience, and in my opinion this
can and should be improved as navigating Info pages is a very crucial part of
using Emacs.

Personally I have bound J/K to scroll page up/down in buffers/pdf/djvu/doc-view,
which I inherited from using the zathura pdf reader, and I think this is a better
default than the default vim alternatives.

Quick refactoring of DeliveryService into extensions methods so that can be tested more easily and a few tests using that same testcases (not exhaustive). This would be the two hour point - although I've had a number of interruptions while doing this. However I will continue and finish the final implementation step either tonight or tomorrow morning.
