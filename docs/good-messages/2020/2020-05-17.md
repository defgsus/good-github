importer: Quote filenames with spaces for tmpfiles.d

This way we handle filenames with spaces in `/var` in general,
like `/var/app/foo bar`, but *also* the special `/opt/foo bar`
translation bits.

I saw this bug and thought "oh that'd be easy".  But hoo boy
did it take me down a rat's nest.  The first thing was verifying
that `systemd-tmpfiles` supports any kind of quotation/escaping; it does.
The next thing was figuring out *exactly* what the syntax for that
is and how it works, as it's obviously not widely used.

Writing tests for this ended up being a painful exercise because
of the multiple levels of shell script, e.g. our `build_rpm` shell
script ends up being inlined into RPM specs, which then interprets
again...and not to mention the usual annoying issues with `ssh`
eating quotes.

Anyways, all that and:

#### Sunday 2020-05-17 09:57:37 by Marko Grdiniƒá

"8am. I am up. Let me chill for a while.

8:15am. Let me read Hellrage and then I am going to resume the CML book. I actually like that it is covering the basic concurrency primitives as that is in fact what I need to understand how all this works. My plan is to go through the book and then clone the NetMQ and Hopac repos and study them as I play with them.

If I can master messaging, channels and reactive combinators then I am pretty much set as far as concurrency is concerned. At that point I will reach a new pinnacle as a programmer and I will be set as far as all real world needs are concerned.

I've been a bit insecure in my employability ability over having to monkey UIs and not knowing much about web development.

8:30am. It is not a big deal to get a job, but to get highly paid ones you need something special. Not that I am aiming for that, but in the future I will end up in a position where I have to bargain to get to the next step and I need to be able to show something impressive. What I have in v0.09 is not enough.

I need to be able to produce programs that have good and even great user experience. That is the main skill I am missing as a programmer.

8:35am. Let me strive for it again today. Two weeks are left in May. Let me make good use for them so I can write something good for the review.

8:50am.

> The other situation arises when the state of the shared object determines which operations are enabled. For example, a shared object might allow multiple readers to access it concurrently, but require exclusive access for writers. In this case, both the read and write operations are disabled when another process is writing, and the write operation is disabled when processes are performing reads. A process uses condition synchronization to wait until some condition holds before executing an operation.

I actually do not know whether this is true for files. A while back I spent some thinking about it and came to the conclusion that this is how files should work, but I have no idea whether that is actually the case. But still there has to be a reason why I have to say whether I am opening a file for input or output.

9:05am. 34/325. The code here is short, but I do not understand it.

```
fun insert (buf as BUF{data, lockSem, ...}, v) = (
P lockSem;
case !data
of NONE => (data := SOME v; signal buf; V lockSem)
| (SOME _) => (wait buf; insert (buf, v))
```

What is this supposed to be doing?

9:20am. I understand it now. It makes sense. It would make even more sense if `waiting` was not a reference, but instead you could fetch the value of the semaphore directly.

9:25am. 35/325. Hmmm, what is this?

Let me just say, that I am digging this book so far. This is real learning.

...Wow, this example is super elegant.

9:30am. No doubt, what I've just seen here is how channels are implemented.

9:35am.

> The term mutex lock is essentially another name for a binary semaphore (it is a contraction of ‚Äúmutual exclusion‚Äù).

I actually hadn't known this.

9:45am. 37/325. He is right, this version really is much clearer than the first one.

So far, this book is really setting a high bar. John Reppy does actually know how to program.

Yesterday I thought of just skimming this book, but now I convinced that I should give it my full attention.

9:50am.

> We could use a single condition variable to block waiting processes, but then we would have had to use broadcast to support sharing of the buffer between multiple producers and consumers (as we did in the semaphore implementation).

This part confuses me as nowhere was broadcast used.

10:10am.

```
    let right_associative_ops =
        let f str prec = add_infix_operator Associativity.Right str prec
        f "||" 20; f "&&" 30; f "::" 50; f "^^^" 45; f "<|" 10; f "<<" 10
        f ";" 4; f "," 5; f ":>" 35; f ":?>" 35; f "**" 80
```

I've been thinking about making `<|` and `<<` right associative since yesterday. Let me do it.

```
f "^^^" 45;
```

Also let me change this to `^`. I keep forgetting that F# has a string concatenation operator.

10:35am. Did the changes to the parser I talked about.

41/325. Channels are really simple, aren't they? This really is much more lightweight than having actor frameworks. I am sold. Sure actors have advantages when it comes to clustering across machine, but I can just use ZeroMQ for that. For a single machine, I really should be using reactive pulls.

```
fun remove (BUF{remCh, remAckCh, ...}) =
    (recv remCh) before send(remAckCh, ())
```

Is `before` a keyword here synonymous with `;`. I'll assume so.

>  Because the two processes must wait for each other, synchronous message passing is sometimes called rendezvous (or simple rendezvous).

10:50am. One thing I still do not get from yesterday is once you have alternatives why is it necessary to have two channels. I guess I'll figure that out as I go along.

11:20am. 46/325. The discussion of synchronous and asynchronous message passing here is interesting.

11:45am. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15657637/condition-variables-c-net

11:50am. http://deadlockempire.github.io/#menu

This is interesting.

11:55am. 55/325. Done with chapter two. Let me stop here for the morning."

Add files via upload

(I couldn't upload the images folder here because github says only 100 files or less, so the website will be broken)
**boring story about my coding:**
i think this could be considered my first real [coding?] project. my mom needed a website for her business, and i, despite just beginning to learn HTML and programming said: "hire me! I'm totally competent and capable of building a website form scratch!" this is the result. a mess. but now that i look back at it, i feel as if i made some progress 20 months after starting, but i wasn't doing it consistently all those 20 months. probably about three quarters wasn't spent coding because of school. fuck school for burning my neurons and almost killing my interest in astronomy this year. But ironically, school introduced me to HTML, which led to everything else: learning coding, science, and math. school didnt teach me any of those, though. I had to teach them all to myself -May 17.2020

Make Cypress at home

Commit all the crap (probably mostly unwanted) that came with it, but in an appropriate corner of the app that doesn't make Cypress a first-class citizen.

Make sure videos and screenshots won't be committed.

Honestly I've been wrong many times in my life, but so far Cypress seems very much in favor of making itself the star of the show and doing things for you in an opinionated and magic way.

I'm leaning towards building a UI client for browser acceptance testing that wraps Cypress functionality for now, writing a few more tests and/or doing so more research, and then likely ripping Cypress out to replace with Nightwatch, Jest with Puppeteer, or something else.

One thing I'm 100% clear I want for the acceptance tests:

Dedicated clients written in strongly-typed JavaScript

Adds some acceptance test musings to the planning directory.

[gl] Add WebP format as an option when taking GL snapshots (Android only) (#7490)

# Why

At some point (API 14), Android added native WebP support ([Bitmap.CompressFormat.WEBP](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap.CompressFormat#WEBP)), so adding the option to export the render to WebP is trivial.
Creating a new module just for converting from PNG to WebP is silly since you can get the GL render as WebP directly. Also converting from PNG to WebP could create quality loss.

# How

In GLContext.java, I extended the block that specifies using png (instead of jpeg, the default) to recognize webp as another posible format.

# Test Plan

Sadly, a combination of living in Windows OS and lack of experience in some aspects of software development, I was not able to test this change using the proper methods (unit test, and that). But I did tried the change in the App I'm building and it worked fine

Thanks for your attention, sorry for any mistake in the PR, this is the second time I do a PR

Wait, is this UpDaTe?

Well ... after a long time, I got back to work. Today I added a couple of pranks and sawed off a couple of pages.
Currently we have:
- Page "Insurance services for legal entities"
- Page "Insurance services for private individuals"
- Contact page (now it‚Äôs empty, but soon everything will be)
- Added a lift button to the top of the page
- And for this button to work, I chopped up the JS and JQuery. (Oh may god. Wow!)
- Now scss looks neater and more beautiful
- Aligned the lines in the footer
- Slightly corrected the color palette (do not worry, the site still looks poisonous green)
- Now I hate working in bootstrap if you need to align the cards using the grid. Moreover, align so that on the smallest screen everything was gorgeous.
- Now the navbar has "3D" buttons (Dudes, you should look at it)

And that's the principle .... yes.
Until we meet again

in repack.c can be removed eventually. Of course this has no purpose at
all, and will not have any. (For now, this provides only metadata, and
nothing uses it, apart from the "test" that dumps it as text.)

This adds full support for AV_PIX_FMT_UYYVYY411 (probably out of spite,
because the format is 100% useless). Support for some mpv-only formats
is missing, ironically.

The code goes through _lengths_ to try to make sense out of the FFmpeg
AVPixFmtDescriptor data. Which is even more amazing that the new
metadata basically mirrors pixdesc, and just adds to it. Considering
code complexity and speed issues (it takes time to crunch through all
this shit all the time), and especially the fact that pixdesc is very
_incomplete_, it would probably better to have our own table to all
formats. But then we'd not scramble every time FFmpeg adds a new format,
which would be annoying. On the other hand, by using pixdesc, we get the
excitement to see whether this code will work, or break everything in
catastrophic ways.

The data structure still sucks a lot. Maybe I'll redo it again. The text
dump is weirdly differently formatted than the C struct - because I'm
not happy with the representation. Maybe I'll redo it all over again.

In summary: this commit does nothing.
