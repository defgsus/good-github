Improve german translations and add some missing strings

This PR takes the translations from https://github.com/statamic/cms/pull/1655 and accounts for the differences between high-german and swiss-german (e.g. ß -> ss).

Additionally it adds support for so far hardwired strings in Blade and VueJs.

It addresses the following issues from https://github.com/statamic/cms/issues/1697:

1. Link Existing Field or Fieldset
	- [X] Sorry, no matching options
	- [X] Button text 'Link'
	- [X] or
	- [X] Placeholder text 'eg. _hero'

2. Password Reset Mail\
   I could not test this because could not convince Statamic to show me the german version of the Forgot Password page and send the german version of the email. I added the translations as described here: https://github.com/laravel/docs/pull/4239/files
	- [X] Hello
	- [X] Regards
	- [ ] If you're having trouble -> Was not able to translate this.

3. Reset password error message
	- [ ] The password must be at least 8 characters.

4. Getting started widget
	- [x] Please remember ...

5. Permissions
	- [x] Title 'Create a Role'
	- [x] 'role' in Learn more about… (But actually there should be only one 'Learn more about…' button?)
	- [ ] No message helper text in the section 'Updates' (also in the en version) -> **String should be added by a maintainer**
	- [ ] No message helper text in the section 'User' (also in the en version) -> **String should be added by a maintainer**

6. Groups
	- [x] Title 'Create a User Group'
	- [x] 'User group updated' message

7. Forms (Blocked by https://github.com/statamic/cms/issues/1896)
	- [ ] Title 'Create a Form'
	- [x] Button 'Add Email'
	- [ ] Recipient (To)
	- [ ] Sender (From)
	- [ ] Subject
	- [ ] Template

8. Choose a blueprint (Blocked by https://github.com/statamic/cms/issues/1896)
	- [ ] 0/1 selected

9. Error message (i.e. when leave required fields blank or use spaces when creating a folder)
	- [x] The given data was invalid

10. Globals
	- [x] Title 'Create a Global Set'

11. Configure global set
	- [x] Content Model

12. Taxonomy
	- [x] Title 'Create a Taxonomy'

13. Collections/Navigations
	- [x] 'Parent' field in the sidebar

14. Revisions
	- [x] Publish -> Placeholder "Choose..."
	- [ ] Is it possible somehow to localize the date in the revision history?\
			  **Question**: It is possible to pass a format string to MomentJS. The question is where should that format be stored?
		- [ ] Site-wide in `.env`
		- [ ] Per user in the user settings
	- [x] Flag 'Publish', 'Unpublish' and 'Revision' in the revision history

15. If entries can contain links ...
	- [x] First Child
	- [x] Entry

16. Dropdowns are often too narrow for german words
	- These are styling issues

17. Sidebar
	- [x] 'Sidebar' in live preview
	- [x] 'Sidebar' in tab-title (when the screen size is too narrow to place the sidebar on the right side)

18. Live Preview
	- [x] 'Choose…' in Responsive Dropdown

19. Edit Blueprint
	- [x] 'Main' Section
	- [x] 'linked fieldset'

20. Add fieldtype
	- [x] Text
	- [x] Media
	- [x] Relationship
	- [x] Structured
	- [x] Special
	- [x] Pickable
	- [x] All fieldtype names

21. Fieldtype: Conditions\
	Did not address these, because I did not got the consequences when translating these. Will investigate this and might add this to an own PR.
	- [ ] equals
	- [ ] not
	- [ ] contains
	- [ ] contains_any
	- [ ] custom

22. Fieldtype: Validation
