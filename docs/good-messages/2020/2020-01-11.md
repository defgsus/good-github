hell yeah

I am feeling decent about the refactoring and classes and renaming and general cleanliness of the code. Let me know your thoughts.
I want to still implement manual traversal and making the view pane scale in size to the input argument.
Once I have the manual traversal down. I think it would be cool to "hide" the treasure and allow a user a finite number of "digs" to try and find the treasure which could be passed in as args.
Then the question how do we make it a game that is challening but doable but also with some level of objectives.

So like maybe a "warm" "cold" "coldest" "hot" based on the distance from the treasure so its like a metal detector? lmao so its like we give hints but its still a chance a user could lose if they don't dig right and then the difficulty gets harder if you only have like 2 digs and we will only indicate "Warm" which is if the distance is less than 2 blocks away. why the fuck am I still typing right now.

Brittany Brenon is Margaret "Heaven" Johnson

Margaret has a little sister who goes by the Alias "Nicole Smith". This Nicole Smith character is the real "Heaven Leigh Johnson", while Margaret used her name for undercover police work and whatever illegal bullshit she does when she is not with me. All Brittany's children are mine.
