t/lib-httpd: make CGIPassAuth support conditional

Commit 988aad99b4 (t5563: add tests for basic and anoymous HTTP access,
2023-02-27) added tests that require Apache to support the CGIPassAuth
directive, which was added in Apache 2.4.13. This is fairly old (~8
years), but recent enough that we still encounter it in the wild (e.g.,
RHEL/CentOS 7, which is not EOL until June 2024).

We can live with skipping the new tests on such a platform. But
unfortunately, since the directive is used unconditionally in our
apache.conf, it means the web server fails to start entirely, and we
cannot run other HTTP tests at all (e.g., the basic ones in t5551).

We can fix that by making the config conditional, and only triggering it
for t5563. That solves the problem for t5551 (which then ignores the
directive entirely). For t5563, we'd see apache complain in start_httpd;
with the default setting of GIT_TEST_HTTPD, we'd then skip the whole
script.

But that leaves one small problem: people may set GIT_TEST_HTTPD=1
explicitly, which instructs the tests to fail (rather than skip) when we
can't start the webserver (to avoid accidentally missing some tests).

This could be worked around by having the user manually set
GIT_SKIP_TESTS on a platform with an older Apache. But we can be a bit
friendlier by doing the version check ourselves and setting an
appropriate prereq. We'll use the (lack of) prereq to then skip the rest
of t5563. In theory we could use the prereq to skip individual tests, but
in practice this whole script depends on it.

Fixes is_station_level() sometimes behaving erratically if the value provided is more complex than just a variable (#75489)

## About The Pull Request
I have been debugging this stupid macro for the past nearly five hours,
to finally figure out why it was breaking. If you had something like `a
||Â 0` in what you called the macro with, it would somehow manage to
break the cache. This makes it far more foolproof, and will ensure that
it doesn't break here anymore, because debugging this has to be one of
the biggest pains in my ass I've ever had.

## Why It's Good For The Game
So shit like this

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/58045821/455122b0-34eb-4ec0-92dd-2775c1f0f878)

Doesn't end up breaking your CI (or even worse, the game in prod), in
places unrelated. At least now it shouldn't be overwriting values in the
cache.

It shouldn't have to do verification that you're doing the right thing,
that should be left on the person using the macro because it was meant
to be faster than a proc call, adding too much verification overhead
kind of just loses some of that speed.

## Changelog

:cl: GoldenAlpharex
fix: Makes checks for the station z level more robust against coders
doing less intuitive stuff, thus protecting it from breaking in weirdly
difficult and seemingly unrelated places (I'm looking at you, nuke
cinematic unit test).

Adds proper armor for security plasmamen. (#75156)

## About The Pull Request
It's kinda strange that security plasmamen has no proper armor and you
can just bully them with bottlesmashes. Literally.
Also suits had no wound armor for some reason, which considering that
mold dies without hand kinda silly too.
And helmets just had no armor besides 1 melee armor.
## Why It's Good For The Game
Plasmamen security won't die that easilly. I mean, still easy to kill
them, but not that much.
## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Security Plasmamen now have Security armor. No bullying them
with bottlesmashes anymore.

Refactors High Luminosity Eyes, fixes a ton of bugs related to it as well as qol improvements (#75040)

## About The Pull Request

The high luminosity eyes item was extremely out of date, broken, and
full of copy paste code from atom lighting. Which is a shame because
they were cool.

On top of all that it was using a special light effect that was not very
performant. I got rid of all that, hooked it into atom lighting as a new
light type, and gave it a new TGUI as well because the old ui prompts
were not great either.

You can now pick a color at random if you want. You can also set the
color and range before surgically implanting them. No more being forced
to go through the color picker when you just want to change the range.

Functionally they should pretty much should be the same as before with
some bonus features (see below).


![dreamseeker_nDeLNyOOG2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13398309/235325530-105fe82e-ecc8-4dc4-9c84-143cc6519688.gif)

Closes https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/issues/61041
Closes https://github.com/Skyrat-SS13/Skyrat-tg/issues/14685

This is 100% completed. I just finished fixing the slight translation
bug when going from 0->1 range (see above gif) and that was the last
thing on my bucket list. I happy enough with this at this point in time.

---

EDIT: 

I have decided to add in one last new feature, and that is...
independent settings for eye color.

<details> <summary>You can now set eye color independently if you
wish</summary>


![dreamseeker_j32B2S4yXQ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13398309/235412568-ffa8e424-8624-4462-9f6f-77c1513aa773.gif)

</details>

The eye color does not modify the light color in any way when set in
this manner, but it can be used for cosmetic purposes.

Kind of makes the item more like cybereyes from cyberpunk, which I think
are pretty neat!

</details>

### What I've done, in more detail:

- refactored high luminosity eyes so they use the atom lighting system
instead of the way they were doing it before
- the new light type, `MOVABLE_LIGHT_BEAM` behaves similarly to
directional lights, with some slight differences. it reuses the same
lighting overlay sprites but scales them vertically to produce a more
focused effect. The result can be seen above. This is in contrast to the
old way, which spawned `range` number of individual 32x32 overlays and
moved them around. This way should perform better as well as be more
maintainable.
- added a new TGUI interface for high luminosity eyes with buttons for
range, a text field for a color hex, a color picker and randomizer
- made the eye overlay emissive when the light is turned on
- range goes from 0 to 5. at range 0, the light overlay is turned off
and you are left with just the emissive eyes.
- added a cosmetic functionality to this item that lets you change the
color of your eyes independently of the lighting (and each other)
- fixed a bug with directional flashlights sometimes not updating their
lighting overlay if you pick them up without changing your direction
---

### Other Misc Fixes

Being able to dynamically set range back and forth exposed some logic
issues that had existed with directional light overlays and I have fixed
those. That is why there are some edits in that file that may not appear
readily obvious why they are there.

Apart from that, two other bugs that come to mind:
1) eye code was supposed to keep track of the eye color you had before
you got new eyes, but it was overwriting that every time you ran
refresh().
2) lighting was supposed to be turning off the light when range is set
to 0, but it was not doing that properly.

And of course besides that, there may have been a few instances of
finding typos/tidying up code

## Why It's Good For The Game

The code for this was like 6 years old and in desperate need of
updating. Now it works, and has a nicer UI.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: high luminosity eyes light overlays now follow the user correctly
qol: high luminosity eyes now have a tgui menu so you no longer have to
go through the color picker every time you want to change the range.
they also have a new setting that lets you change the color of your eyes
independently of the light color. You can now have cybernetic
heterochromia if you want
fix: directional flashlights when picked up will now always update their
cast light direction correctly no matter what dir you are facing
refactor: refactors high luminosity eye code to better make use of the
atom lighting system, adding a new light type 'MOVABLE_LIGHT_BEAM'

Mafia rebalance and backend refactor (#74640)

## About The Pull Request

Turns all Mafia abilities into datums, instead of being a bunch of
shitcode on every single job.
This means it's easier to add new roles
Gives new names to some defines (such as the signal order, to make it
easier to tell when something is fired)
Adds support for modular Mafia jobs with their abilities being in a
certain order (Escort is now properly first).
De-snowflakes Changeling killing abilities and day voting, they're now
actions that are tallied when necessary.

Turns time vars into defines
Generalizes a lot of behavior for abilities, now all abilities can
properly undo their action at night

Fixes problems with the UI (Thoughtfeeder had 2 buttons during night and
they overlapped with names, that's been fixed).

### Behavior changes

- Doctor/Officer can now protect themselves 1 night, because it gives
them a way to protect themselves.
- Lawyer/Warden/Ect now choose their abilities at night, rather than the
day before. The suspense building up towards the end of the night is
part of the game, telling you that it happened at the very start is
quite lame (in the case of Lawyer, anyway).
- Admin setup now uses TGUI instead of html inputs.
- Cut night time by like, 5 seconds, because I found it a little long
lol.
- HoP doesn't count as votes to win until they reveal, because it makes
no sense an unrevealed HoP has their unrevealed votes tallied. I also
like those 1v1 Mayor V. Evil scenarios where dead chat goes crazy, and
hope to replicate that here.
- Mafia now needs 6 people to start instead of 4, because 4 players is
just not enough to play a Mafia round that will do anything but annoy
people.
- The game no longer ends if it's in a standoff with 1 Town, 1 Mafia,
and 1 Neutral, as you've got a kingmaker and they should decide who
wins.

### Things I want to change in the future
Every time night starts/ends, it checks the entire ``GLOB.airlocks`` for
doors with the "mafia" ID. This is stupid.
Rework ``check_victory()`` to make it make more sense, and be more fun
for players.
A visible death animation?
I want to use something similar to admin popup for messages about people
being on stand, and decluttering the UI in general
Also more use of balloon alerts instead of to chat messages for
everything.
Also also, making the UI more responsive to players. Button should be
red when a player is selected, so they know that's who they've selected,
if they want to unselect.
Are votes public when you first cast them? They shouldn't be wtf.
Can we also make the description for roles not be a to chat message? It
can just say when you hover over the '?' come on.
User-written wills instead of auto-generated, and able to send them in
chat
Add support for roleblock-immune roles

## Why It's Good For The Game

Updates a lot of old code to modern standards
Makes it considerably easier to work with Mafia and add new roles
Makes things less prone to breaking as easily.
Code also looks a lot cleaner now.

## Changelog

:cl:
refactor: [Mafia] All Mafia abilities have been overhauled in the
backend, it's now much easier to understand what each role's ability can
do and how it works.
admin: [Mafia] Admin setup of Mafia is now in TGUI
balance: [Mafia] Doctors/Officers can protect themselves once per game.
Be careful around them!
fix: [Mafia] Thoughtfeeder's UI buttons at night won't overlap with
eachother.
fix: [Mafia] HoP's votes now actually matter, instead of being purely
visual.
qol: [Mafia] Lawyers, Wardens, etc. now perform their night ability at
night, instead of the day prior.
qol: [Mafia] Night time now lasts 40 seconds instead of 45.

Hologram Touchup (Init savings edition) (#74793)

## About The Pull Request

### Polishes and Reworks Holograms

Hologram generation currently involves a bunch of icon operations, which
are slow.
Not to mention a series of get flats for the human models, which is even
worse.

We lose 0.05 seconds of init to em off just the 2 RCD holograms. it
hurts man.

So instead, let's use filters and render steps to achive the same
effect.

While I'm here I'll dim the holo light and make it blue, make the
hologram and its beam emissive (so they glow), and do some fenangling
with move_hologram() (it doesn't clear the hologram off failure anymore,
instead relying on callers to do that) to ensure holocalls can't be
accidentially ended by moving out of the area.

Ah and I added RESET_ALPHA to the emissive appearance flags, cause the
alpha does override and fuck with color rendering, which ends up looking
dumb. If we're gonna support this stuff it should be first class not
accidential.

### Makes Static Not Shit

While I'm here (since holograms see static) lets ensure the static plane
is always visible if you're seeing through an ai eye.

The old solution was limited to applying it to JUST ais, which isn't
satisfactory for this sort of thing and missed a LOT of cases (I didn't
really get how ai eyes worked before I'ma be honest)

I'm adding a signal off the hud for it detecting a change in its eye
here.
This is semi redundant, but avoids unneeded dupe work, so I'm ok with
it.

The pipeline here is less sane then I'd like, but it works and that's
enough

More pretty, better ux, **static works**

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Holograms glow now, pokes at the lighting for holocalls in general
a bit to make em nicer.
qol: You can no longer accidentally end a holocall (as a non ai) by
leaving the area. Felt like garbage

Allows Export of your Preferences JSON File (#75014)

## About The Pull Request

Hey there,

This was spoken about in #70492 (specifically
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/70492#issuecomment-1278069607),
and I have been waiting for this to be implemented for some time. It
never got implemented, so I decided to code it myself.

Basically, **if the server host doesn't disable it**, you are free to
export your JSONs as a player, right from the stat-panel. It's a pretty
JSON on 515 versions, too!

It's right here:


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34697715/235251447-1c977718-51fd-4025-8d89-c60bffc379ec.png)

Here's what the prettified JSON looks like on 515.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34697715/235321061-4a217e26-c082-4bba-b54a-2c780defda0a.png)

There's a cooldown (default to 10 seconds) between exporting your
preferences.

#### Why is this config?

It's because in the past, a server host could always just file-share the
.sav or .json or whatever to the player, but they would have to do the
explicit option of actually bothering to make the files accessible to
the player. In that same line of logic, the server operator will have to
explicitly make the files accessible. This is mostly because I'm not
sure how good `ftp()` is at being a player function and wanted to have
some sort of cap/control somehow in case an exploit vector is detected
or it's just plain spammed by bots, so we'll just leave it up to the
direct providers of this data to elect if they wish to provide the data
or not.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Players don't have to log into Server A to remember what hairstyle they
loved using when they want to swap to Server B! That's amazing actually.
I always forget what ponytail my character has, and it'll be nice to
have the hairstyle in a readily accessible place (after I prettify the
JSON for myself).

It's also more convenient for server hosts to make player data like this
accessible if they really want to, too.

If we ever add an _import_ feature in the future (which would have to be
done with a LOT of care), this will also be useful. I wouldn't advise it
though having taken a precursory look at how much goes into it while
trying to ascertain the scope of this PR.
## Changelog
:cl:
qol: The game now supports export of your preferences into a JSON file!
The verb (export-preferences) should now be available in the OOC tab of
your stat-panel if enabled by server operators.
server: Exporting player preferences is controlled by a configuration
option, 'FORBID_PREFERENCES_EXPORT'. If you do not wish to let clients
access the ftp() function to their own preferences file (probably for
bandwidth reasons?) you should uncomment this or add it to your config
somehow.
config: Server operators are also able to set the cooldown between
requests to download the JSON Preferences file via the
'SECONDS_COOLDOWN_FOR_PREFERENCES_EXPORT' config option.

[Eval] An array of Liar Paradox-based evals (#883)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! â¥ï¸

ð¨ Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. ð¨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
logic-liar-paradox

### Eval description

An array of Liar Paradox-based evals, examining the model's proficiency
in navigating linguistic nuances and logical reasoning within
self-referential statements.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This eval is particularly useful because it delves into complex, nuanced
logical concepts and self-referential statements, which have
historically posed challenges for AI models. By exploring various
contexts, alternative logical frameworks, and modifications to
statements, this eval helps assess the model's ability to adapt to
different perspectives, grasp subtleties in language, and engage in
flexible reasoning. The ability to understand and navigate paradoxes is
an essential aspect of human-like reasoning, and improving an AI model's
performance in this area would significantly enhance its overall
usefulness and reliability in real-world applications. Additionally,
showcasing the model's improved proficiency in handling paradoxes would
not only make for a compelling marketing angle (as paradoxes are
understood by a much broader range of people than other difficult tasks
such as pure maths or quantum mechanics) but it would also demonstrate
the progress made in AI's capacity to think and reason more like humans.
It also adds paradox-absorbing crumple zones.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

- [x] Addresses complex logical reasoning: The eval focuses on AI's
ability to comprehend and navigate paradoxes, self-referential
statements, and context switching, which are important aspects of
human-like reasoning. By testing the model's proficiency in these areas,
we can identify areas for improvement and work towards enhancing AI's
overall capacity to think and reason more like humans.
- [x] Demonstrates adaptability and flexibility: The eval showcases the
model's ability to switch between contexts, alter premises, and engage
with different dimensions of inferred logic. This will help assess the
model's adaptability and flexibility in diverse real-world situations,
making it more reliable and useful.
- [x] Contributes to AI safety and understanding: By identifying the
model's weaknesses and limitations in handling paradoxes and complex
logical constructs, the eval can contribute to AI safety and enable
researchers to better understand the challenges faced by large language
models in these areas.
- [x] Engaging and appealing: An eval that delves into paradoxes and
complex thought exercises is not only intellectually stimulating but
also adds an appealing element to showcase the model's capabilities,
making it more attractive for both researchers and end-users.

### Unique eval value

- [x] Encourages creativity and lateral thinking: The eval, by focusing
on paradoxes and complex logical constructs, encourages both the AI and
its developers to think creatively and approach problem-solving from
unconventional angles. This can lead to the discovery of novel solutions
and a better understanding of the model's capabilities.
- [x] Aligns with human values and expectations: An AI that can
successfully navigate paradoxes and complex logic is more likely to
align with human values and expectations. By addressing these challenges
in the eval, we strive to develop AI systems that understand and respect
the nuances of human thought and communication.
- [x] Addresses a broad range of applications: Improved reasoning and
context-switching abilities can have a significant impact on various AI
applications, including natural language understanding, decision-making,
and problem-solving in domains such as law, philosophy, ethics, and
more.
- [x] Fosters interdisciplinary collaboration: The exploration of
paradoxes and complex logic often draws upon insights from multiple
disciplines, including philosophy, linguistics, psychology, and computer
science. This eval can help foster interdisciplinary collaboration,
leading to richer and more diverse perspectives on AI development and
its potential impact on society.

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist ð

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

<details>
  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>

  ### Eval

paradox; it is a tautology."}
{"input":[{"role":"system","content":"Does the statement \"This sentence

true\" creates a paradox, as it is a variant of the Liar Paradox."}
{"input":[{"role":"system","content":"What is the difference between a

to a self-contradictory or logically unacceptable conclusion, while a
tautology is a statement that is always true by its logical form."}
{"input":[{"role":"system","content":"Can the Liar Paradox be resolved
by assuming that sentences can have both true and false
values?"}],"ideal":"No, the Liar Paradox cannot be resolved by assuming
that sentences can have both true and false values, as this would lead
to a different kind of paradox called the \"Dialetheism Paradox.\""}
{"input":[{"role":"system","content":"Consider the statement \"This
sentence is neither true nor false.\" Is this statement an example of
the Liar Paradox?"}],"ideal":"This statement, \"This sentence is neither
true nor false,\" is not an example of the Liar Paradox, but it is a
similar paradox known as the 'truth-teller paradox' or the 'strengthened
liar paradox.' It creates a paradoxical situation because if the
statement is true, then it is neither true nor false, which contradicts
its truth. If the statement is false, then it is not the case that it is
neither true nor false, which implies that it is either true or false,
again leading to a contradiction. The paradox arises due to
self-reference and the inability to assign a consistent truth value to
the statement."}

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
Do math problems related to calculating dates using the Chinese
Sexagenary Cycle method

### Eval description

The Sexagenary Cycle combines 10 Heavenly Stems (Jia ç², Yi ä¹, Bing ä¸,
Ding ä¸, Wu æ, Ji å·±, Geng åº, Xin è¾, Ren å£¬, Gui ç¸) and 12 Earthly Branches
(Zi å­, Chou ä¸, Yin å¯, Mao å¯, Chen è¾°, Si å·³, Wu å, Wei æª, Shen ç³, You é,
Xu æ, Hai äº¥) to form a 60-unit cycle. To calculate, convert the
Gregorian date to its corresponding Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch
combination, used for marking specific years, months, and days.

### What makes this a useful eval?

The existing GPT models tend to make errors when performing calculations
related to the Sexagenary Cycle. To address this issue, we have provided
a specialized dataset aimed at improving the model's accuracy in
handling Sexagenary Cycle calculations.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,

- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please

Medevac Buffs (#1513)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->

## About The Pull Request
Reduces cooldown of medevac from 60 seconds to 20 seconds. PO no longer
needs to manually activate the winch, so medevac can be operated from
the cockpit. What's more, you can operate medevac by interacting with
the medevac system itself, and even if you don't have the skills of a
pilot, you can use it if you have the skills of a doctor (which means
nurse can run medevac). And finally, the medical stretcher is now
automatically activated when deployed.

I know there is a PR by jeser that reduces cooldown, but it stuck in PR
hell anyway and also I changed more stuff.

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is

## Why It's Good For The Game
Since we want to force wounded marines to go shipside, we must provide
them a more convenient way to reach the Almayer. Medevac was always
underutilized because it required too much coordination and unnecessary
actions (e.g. having to activate medical stretcher every time, keep in
mind a huge portion of the medic playerbase still has no idea you need
to do this). PO had to spend their limited fly-by time (which should
normally be used on firemissions) to manually activating the winch,
which was always annoying. And cooldown is ridiculous. You have at best
three minutes of fly-by, so that means you could use medevac only twice
(remember that you needed to run to the system every time) per fly-by,
which is definitely not enough.
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be
worth adding, and may discourage maintainers from reviewing or merging
your PR. This section is not strictly required for (non-controversial)
fix PRs or backend PRs. -->

## Changelog

<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the
icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags,
changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by
the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. Please note that
maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags should they
deem it appropriate. You can attempt to finagle the system all you want,
but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off the bat. -->

balance: reduced the medevac cooldown from 60 seconds to 20 seconds.
add: anyone with the skills of a doctor or a pilot can manage the
medevac by interacting with the system itself.
qol: medical stretcher automatically activates when deployed.

Add eval for guessing the singer or band (#659)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! â¥ï¸

ð¨ Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. ð¨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
guess-the-singer

### Eval description

This evaluation measures the model's ability to identify a singer or
band by analyzing the first 10 words of a song. To ensure the
evaluation's fairness and focus, we have excluded songs with multiple
singers/bands and included only those published before 2021. To test the
model's performance, we provide it with three potential choices and
evaluate its accuracy in selecting the correct one.

### What makes this a useful eval?

The inclusion of over 4000 popular songs' lyrics provides a large and
diverse dataset for the model to test on. This enables a more accurate
assessment of the model's performance and its ability to identify
singers/bands based on the first 10 words of their songs.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> This evaluation assesses not only the model's ability to recognize a
singer or band based on the first 10 words of a song but also its
capability to accurately copy the provided options without adding any
additional punctuation or text. By testing the model's ability to
replicate the options, we can gain insights into its language generation
capabilities and identify any areas for improvement in its output.
Accuracy achieved with gpt-3.5-turbo equals 0.635.


## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist ð

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Find country from svg (#418)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! â¥ï¸

ð¨ Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
Find country from svg

### Eval description

Test the model's ability to distinguish a country based on its svg shape
(from wikimedia svg file).

### What makes this a useful eval?

Multiple real life use case, the first one would be to understand that a
svg shape is a country (it could be very useful for scraps via [Text
from:] prompts). On the opposite side, while asking to create an app or
a website (with a map, I just had the case for a client), GPT would
currently hint you to find the svg of the country on the web, mainly
linking to wikimedia, this solution is quicker.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some

- [X] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [X] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [X] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

GPT currently lacks of geography "knowledge" (I've tried him on multiple
tasks where it fails), this evals would help him "recognize" country
shapes, if that's a thing ?

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should
- [X] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [X] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [X] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

Add evals for complementary colors in color theory (#749)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! â¥ï¸

ð¨ Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. ð¨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
color_theory_complementary

### Eval description

Test the model's ability to accurately recognize complementary colors in
the color theory.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Color theory is an important tool for designers and aritsts alike.
Complementary color sets represent the opposite color on the color
wheel.

Currently gpt-3.5-turbo fails with 0.5 accuracy.

GPT 4 also fails at this task and also fails when being prompted about
complementary color of a specific rgb code.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [X] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [X] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [X] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [X] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should
- [X] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [X] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [X] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist ð

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [X] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [X] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [X] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [X] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [X] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

[eval] swap two words (#280)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! â¥ï¸

ð¨ Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. ð¨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
Swap Words

### Eval description

This eval asks the model to swap two random words, so "chat gpt" should
become "gpt chat"

### What makes this a useful eval?

Robustly being able to swap words around seems like a foundational
capability the model should know, as moving things around probably helps
a lot with logic/math tasks if the model is thinking out aloud.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.jsonl`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist ð

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

Evals for Spanish Feminine Nouns with Masculine Articles (#861)

Added evals for feminine Spanish words that should have masculine
articles

eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
spanish_feminine_noun_masculine_article

### Eval description

In Spanish singular feminine words are usually proceeded by La as in La
casa (the house), however many feminine words that start with an "a"
sound are proceeded by El instead of La as in El agua (the water)

### What makes this a useful eval?

For people learning Spanish its a very common mistake to write La agua
(because agua is feminine) but this is not correct. GPT should not
reinforce this mistake especially for people learning or asking
questions about Spanish words.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite

Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

For students using GPT to learn Spanish its very important that the
model knows all the rules and the exceptions to those rules or the
students will be mislead

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at

Detect highly sensitive human data (#852)

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
Detecting highly sensitive human data
### Eval description
This eval tests whether models can successfully detect possible highly
sensitive human data without returning false positives on values that
cannot exist in practice. There are many types of highly sensitive human
data but some of the most common and types are but not limited to social
security numbers, passport numbers, credit card numbers, and driver's
licenses. Not all values are valid for a given type. For example, credit
card numbers have a numbering system specified by
https://www.iso.org/standard/39698.html, and use check digits to
validate.

Similarly, passport numbers must comply with the ICAO D9303
https://www.icao.int/publications/documents/9303_p4_cons_en.pdf

### What makes this a useful eval?
Institutions spend millions of dollars trying to detect non-encrypted
HSHD in their internal datasets. A combination of regex, ML, and
hard-coded logic is often used yielding complicated, hard to maintain
codebases. The risk associated with plaintext HSHD is high and certain
institutions can be subject to heavy fines if HSHD is leaked if not
properly stored.


## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good

eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value
This eval combines many aspects of language processing and
understanding. The task involves understanding what HSHD are, domain
knowledge about what makes them valid, and algorithmic understanding in
order to validate (i.e. check digits)

[Eval] Mandaliof table test (#847)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! â¥ï¸

ð¨ Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. ð¨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
Mandaliof table test

### Eval description

This Eval is checking if the model can find a specific atom with the
highest atomic number among 20 different atoms.

### What makes this a useful eval?

There are applications in biophysics and biochemistry (like drug
discovery) that rely on physics equations and induction on atom
features. If ChatGPT is going to be used in this field, it should be
very reliable in case of understanding physical facts. Interpretation of
the periodic table is a very simple Eval that shows the model is still
unreliable for use cases in this field.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [X] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [X] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [X] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [X] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

Physics problems are almost the most difficult tasks for any deep
learning model since they are based on fundamentals of nature, and even
humans are not capable of understanding comprehensive explanations of
them. In this regard, if ChatGPT will be able to interpret physical
facts, it is very likely that it can interpret literally everything
because even human are not able to do that.

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

Mandaliof table is the basic of physics.

Your eval should
- [X] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [X] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [X] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

Identify which scale mode a series of notes belongs to (#860)

Added evals to determine the scale mode name based off the nodes in the
scale

# Thank you for contributing an eval! â¥ï¸

ð¨ Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. ð¨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
music_theory_scale_modes

### Eval description
Test the model's ability to identify which western music scale a series
of 7 notes belongs to

### What makes this a useful eval?

This is good for analyzing music or getting help with music theory
problems like figuring out which scale to use to solo over a series of
chords, or which scale to use to write a melody depending on the mood or
chord selection.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

GPT-4 often hallucinates on these and will give a confident incorrect
answer

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist ð

### Submission agreement

Replaces the syndicate corpse Legions can drop with one without a MODSuit (#75700)

## About The Pull Request
This is part of a pass I'm working on doing where I go through and
remove instances of antag gear outside of their normal context. This is
mostly going to involve replacing space/Lavaland ruin gear with
something close to the same power level but not distinctly something
only antags should be able to get. I want to keep ruins rewarding but I
don't want explicit antag gear to be something you can obtain without
needing an uplink.

The first part of this is me removing the MODSuit from the syndicate
operative corpse. The new one drops a turtleneck, a syndicate gas mask,
and gripper gloves.

## Why It's Good For The Game
It's my opinion that antag gear should probably stay in antag hands
unless you manage to kill one or steal an uplink. The main impetus for
this was a discussion I had a while back about how blood red hardsuits
used to _just_ be an antag thing. I kind of miss that general feeling of
paranoia that came from seeing someone wearing it, as opposed to seeing
it these days and just thinking "Yeah, it's probably someone who got it
from space".

In this specific instance, Syndicate MODSuits are pretty strong anyway
and, regardless of the low odds of getting one, I really don't think it
should be available as loot off a fairly easy-to-kill mob.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Syndicate corpses dropped from killing a Legion no longer come
with a MODSuit.

mm: vmscan: fix extreme overreclaim and swap floods

commit f53af4285d775cd9a9a146fc438bd0a1bee1838a upstream.

During proactive reclaim, we sometimes observe severe overreclaim, with
several thousand times more pages reclaimed than requested.

This trace was obtained from shrink_lruvec() during such an instance:

    prio:0 anon_cost:1141521 file_cost:7767
    nr_reclaimed:4387406 nr_to_reclaim:1047 (or_factor:4190)
    nr=[7161123 345 578 1111]

While he reclaimer requested 4M, vmscan reclaimed close to 16G, most of it
by swapping.  These requests take over a minute, during which the write()
to memory.reclaim is unkillably stuck inside the kernel.

Digging into the source, this is caused by the proportional reclaim
bailout logic.  This code tries to resolve a fundamental conflict: to
reclaim roughly what was requested, while also aging all LRUs fairly and
in accordance to their size, swappiness, refault rates etc.  The way it
attempts fairness is that once the reclaim goal has been reached, it stops
scanning the LRUs with the smaller remaining scan targets, and adjusts the
remainder of the bigger LRUs according to how much of the smaller LRUs was
scanned.  It then finishes scanning that remainder regardless of the
reclaim goal.

This works fine if priority levels are low and the LRU lists are
comparable in size.  However, in this instance, the cgroup that is
targeted by proactive reclaim has almost no files left - they've already
been squeezed out by proactive reclaim earlier - and the remaining anon
pages are hot.  Anon rotations cause the priority level to drop to 0,
which results in reclaim targeting all of anon (a lot) and all of file
(almost nothing).  By the time reclaim decides to bail, it has scanned
most or all of the file target, and therefor must also scan most or all of
the enormous anon target.  This target is thousands of times larger than
the reclaim goal, thus causing the overreclaim.

The bailout code hasn't changed in years, why is this failing now?  The
most likely explanations are two other recent changes in anon reclaim:

1. Before the series starting with commit 5df741963d52 ("mm: fix LRU
   balancing effect of new transparent huge pages"), the VM was
   overall relatively reluctant to swap at all, even if swap was
   configured. This means the LRU balancing code didn't come into play
   as often as it does now, and mostly in high pressure situations
   where pronounced swap activity wouldn't be as surprising.

2. For historic reasons, shrink_lruvec() loops on the scan targets of
   all LRU lists except the active anon one, meaning it would bail if
   the only remaining pages to scan were active anon - even if there
   were a lot of them.

   Before the series starting with commit ccc5dc67340c ("mm/vmscan:
   make active/inactive ratio as 1:1 for anon lru"), most anon pages
   would live on the active LRU; the inactive one would contain only a
   handful of preselected reclaim candidates. After the series, anon
   gets aged similarly to file, and the inactive list is the default
   for new anon pages as well, making it often the much bigger list.

   As a result, the VM is now more likely to actually finish large
   anon targets than before.

Change the code such that only one SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX-sized nudge toward the
larger LRU lists is made before bailing out on a met reclaim goal.

This fixes the extreme overreclaim problem.

Fairness is more subtle and harder to evaluate.  No obvious misbehavior
was observed on the test workload, in any case.  Conceptually, fairness
should primarily be a cumulative effect from regular, lower priority
scans.  Once the VM is in trouble and needs to escalate scan targets to
make forward progress, fairness needs to take a backseat.  This is also
acknowledged by the myriad exceptions in get_scan_count().  This patch
makes fairness decrease gradually, as it keeps fairness work static over
increasing priority levels with growing scan targets.  This should make
more sense - although we may have to re-visit the exact values.

Allow kernel squashfs / extfs mount to be disabled in singularity.conf (release-3.11)

In singularity.conf, add two directives `allow kernel squashfs` and
`allow kernel extfs` which default to 'yes'. When set to 'no', these
directives prevent a squashfs mount or extfs mount from being
performed through the kernel. Note that this only happens in setuid
mode / as root.

squashfs and extfs mounts are added from the various locations that
handle loopback mounting of a filesystem image. The image could be a
container rootfs, an overlay, or an image bind. In each case the image
may be a standalone file or embedded in a SIF.

The simplest place to gate these mounts is in mount.AddImage, via the
existing check that the fs type is authorized as the source for an
image mount.

Authorized filesystems for image mounts are held in a package var. At
the start of container creation we now explicitly authorize squashfs
and extfs, unless disabled by singularity.conf.

Relying on a package scope variable isn't ideal. We have multiple
processes at container creation, so the authorization must be
performed in the right place. e2e tests have been added to verify
overlay, image bind, and container rootfs image flows.

Gating the filesystems earlier in the `PrepareConfig` portion of the
runtime is, in my opinion, more liable to errors as the checks would
have to be replicated in the multiple places that images are handled.

Ideally the mount.System could perhaps hold the list of allowed /
disallowed filesystems, that could be set when it is created. However,
this would require a large amount of refactoring to complex and
critical code.

memory-device: Add a memslot soft-limit for memory devices and warn the user

While we properly check before plugging a memory device whether there
still is a free memslot, we have other memslot consumers (especially PCI
BARs) that don't perform any checks and might dynamically consume
memslots without any prior reservation later. So we might succeed in
plugging a memory device, but once we dynamically map a PCI BAR we would
be in trouble.

Let's indicate to the user that we cannot guarantee that everything will
work as intended and that we might run out of free memslots later. We'll
warn once, when we detect that there are not that many memslots around,
and once we then exceed the calculated soft-limit.

As long as we don't have to warn the user (IOW, at least 253 memslots set
aside), we don't expect surprises. Especially environments with very little
memslots (32 with vhost-user) are quite possibly problematic.

We use the historic magic memslot number of 509 as orientation to when
supporting 256 memory devices (leaving 253 for boot memory and other
devices) has been proven to work reliable. We'll warn on anything below
that for now.

We still allow to exceed the soft-limit, because there might be
reasonable setups that simply work.

We'll cap the soft-limit at 512, which no setup should currently really
exceed (ACPI supports a maximum of 256 slots). Note that the soft-limit
will be used in virtio-mem context soon, when auto-determining the number
of memslots to use.

virtio-mem: Expose device memory via multiple memslots if enabled

Having large virtio-mem devices that only expose little memory to a VM
is currently a problem: we map the whole sparse memory region into the
guest using a single memslot, resulting in one gigantic memslot in KVM.
KVM allocates metadata for the whole memslot, which can result in quite
some memory waste.

Assuming we have a 1 TiB virtio-mem device and only expose little (e.g.,
1 GiB) memory, we would create a single 1 TiB memslot and KVM has to
allocate metadata for that 1 TiB memslot: on x86, this implies allocating
meatdata for:

(1) RMAP: ~0.2% (~2100 MiB). Not that this is optimized out with the TDP
    MMU, but will be allocated lazily when running nested VMs.
(2) gfn_track: 0.024% (~252 MiB)
(3) Bitmap when dirty-tracking: 2 x 0.003% (~63 MiB)

Consequently, using multiple memslots and only mapping the memslots we
really need can significantly reduce memory waste and speed up
memslot-related operations. Let's expose the sparse RAM memory region using
multiple memslots, mapping only the memslots we currently need into our
device memory region container.

A nice side effect is that we will expose less memory to the guest, so
a malicious guest won't be able to do that much harm and we might be
able to detect some BUGs in well-behaving guests more easily. However,
in the future we'll want to properly protect all unplugged memory from
getting reallocated (using features that have to be separately enabled).

* With VIRTIO_MEM_F_UNPLUGGED_INACCESSIBLE, we only map the memslots that
  actually have memory plugged, and dynamically (un)map when
  (un)plugging memory blocks.

* Without VIRTIO_MEM_F_UNPLUGGED_INACCESSIBLE, we always map the memslots
  covered by the usable region, and dynamically (un)map when resizing the
  usable region.

We'll auto-detect the number of memslots to use based on the remaining
available memslots and the remaining avilable size for memory devices using
our new helper. Further, we'll take care to not consume a crazy number of
memslots, because the assumption is that many memslots can degrade
performance especially in QEMU, at least right now. Let's not use more than
512 memslots per device and not use memslots smaller than 1 GiB for now.
Note that our global limit for all memory devices is currently set to
1024, so even with multiple big virtio-mem devices, we'd still have a sane
limit. We might want to fine-tune these values in the future (might have
to do via compat machine properties).

Still default to a single memslot for now, because it can be problematic in
vhost setups, and we don't want to break existing setups. We'll change
the default via compat machines in the future. Until then, this feature can
be enabled using "force-single-memslot=false".

As vhost devices are currently very limited when it comes to the number
of supported memslots, they have to be defined on the QEMU cmdline
before defining the virtio-mem devices. Otherwise, aut-detection is
unaware of the additional restriction and QEMU will bail out when
realizing the vhost device. Further, hotplug of vhost devices might
require planning ahead.

Note 1: how many memslots we'll be using is an internal implementation
detail (especially: migration is not affected), and we can change the
auto-detection as we please. Values (including "force-single-memslot") can
differ on migration source and destination.

Note 2: we should look into supporting more memslots (512 -- 1024)
especially for vhost-user soon, but that will require changes in QEMU
(to make many memslots scale better) and support in vhost-user
implementations. So we'll have to life with this vhost memslot limitation
oddity for now.

[Experiment] Lazily propagate context changes (#20890)

* Move context comparison to consumer

In the lazy context implementation, not all context changes are
propagated from the provider, so we can't rely on the propagation alone
to mark the consumer as dirty. The consumer needs to compare to the
previous value, like we do for state and context.

I added a `memoizedValue` field to the context dependency type. Then in
the consumer, we iterate over the current dependencies to see if
something changed. We only do this iteration after props and state has
already bailed out, so it's a relatively uncommon path, except at the
root of a changed subtree. Alternatively, we could move these
comparisons into `readContext`, but that's a much hotter path, so I
think this is an appropriate trade off.

* [Experiment] Lazily propagate context changes

When a context provider changes, we scan the tree for matching consumers
and mark them as dirty so that we know they have pending work. This
prevents us from bailing out if, say, an intermediate wrapper is
memoized.

Currently, we propagate these changes eagerly, at the provider.

However, in many cases, we would have ended up visiting the consumer
nodes anyway, as part of the normal render traversal, because there's no
memoized node in between that bails out.

We can save CPU cycles by propagating changes only when we hit a
memoized component â so, instead of propagating eagerly at the provider,
we propagate lazily if or when something bails out.

Most of our bailout logic is centralized in
`bailoutOnAlreadyFinishedWork`, so this ended up being not that
difficult to implement correctly.

There are some exceptions: Suspense and Offscreen. Those are special
because they sometimes defer the rendering of their children to a
completely separate render cycle. In those cases, we must take extra
care to propagate *all* the context changes, not just the first one.

I'm pleasantly surprised at how little I needed to change in this
initial implementation. I was worried I'd have to use the reconciler
fork, but I ended up being able to wrap all my changes in a regular
feature flag. So, we could run an experiment in parallel to our other
ones.

I do consider this a risky rollout overall because of the potential for
subtle semantic deviations. However, the model is simple enough that I
don't expect us to have trouble fixing regressions if or when they arise
during internal dogfooding.

---

This is largely based on [RFC#118](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/118),
by @gnoff. I did deviate in some of the implementation details, though.

The main one is how I chose to track context changes. Instead of storing
a dirty flag on the stack, I added a `memoizedValue` field to the
context dependency object. Then, to check if something has changed, the
consumer compares the new context value to the old (memoized) one.

This is necessary because of Suspense and Offscreen â those components
defer work from one render into a later one. When the subtree continues
rendering, the stack from the previous render is no longer available.
But the memoized values on the dependencies list are. This requires a
bit more work when a consumer bails out, but nothing considerable, and
there are ways we could optimize it even further. Conceptually, this
model is really appealing, since it matches how our other features
"reactively" detect changes â `useMemo`, `useEffect`,
`getDerivedStateFromProps`, the built-in cache, and so on.

I also intentionally dropped support for
`unstable_calculateChangedBits`. We're planning to remove this API
anyway before the next major release, in favor of context selectors.
It's an unstable feature that we never advertised; I don't think it's
seen much adoption.

* Propagate all contexts in single pass

Instead of propagating the tree once per changed context, we can check
all the contexts in a single propagation. This inverts the two loops so
that the faster loop (O(numberOfContexts)) is inside the more expensive
loop (O(numberOfFibers * avgContextDepsPerFiber)).

This adds a bit of overhead to the case where only a single context
changes because you have to unwrap the context from the array. I'm also
unsure if this will hurt cache locality.

Co-Authored-By: Josh Story <jcs.gnoff@gmail.com>

* Stop propagating at nearest dependency match

Because we now propagate all context providers in a single traversal, we
can defer context propagation to a subtree without losing information
about which context providers we're deferring â it's all of them.

Theoretically, this is a big optimization because it means we'll never
propagate to any tree that has work scheduled on it, nor will we ever
propagate the same tree twice.

There's an awkward case related to bailing out of the siblings of a
context consumer. Because those siblings don't bail out until after
they've already entered the begin phase, we have to do extra work to
make sure they don't unecessarily propagate context again. We could
avoid this by adding an earlier bailout for sibling nodes, something
we've discussed in the past. We should consider this during the next
refactor of the fiber tree structure.

Co-Authored-By: Josh Story <jcs.gnoff@gmail.com>

* Mark trees that need propagation in readContext

Instead of storing matched context consumers in a Set, we can mark
when a consumer receives an update inside `readContext`.

I hesistated to put anything in this function because it's such a hot
path, but so are bail outs. Fortunately, we only need to set this flag
once, the first time a context is read. So I think it's a reasonable
trade off.

In exchange, propagation is faster because we no longer need to
accumulate a Set of matched consumers, and fiber bailouts are faster
because we don't need to consult that Set. And the code is simpler.

feat: Add methods for fetching default values

In the application, certain data will have default values (Ex: each user
in NutritionDiaryScreen, which is for tracking nutrition and calories,
has 4 meals by default - Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks). Adding these
values for each user on the database will require enormous efforts, so
the alternative is to group the default values in a different data
source, and merge the default values with user's personal data whenever
fetching data

Wintercoats can now be zipped and unzipped through alt-click and separates the hood sprites from the jacket sprites (#74886)

## About The Pull Request
The title says it all, really.

~~Initially, I was only going to do it for all wintercoats, but then I
figured I might as well bring it down to all of `/hooded`, just so other
suits could benefit from it, since that behavior came from there anyway.
Does that mean that it does nothing for some of them? Yes, it does. Does
that justify having another variable to tell whether or not that should
be possible? In my humble opinion, not really, but I'm not against it if
it's requested.~~

~~That functionality was intentionally removed from the Void Cloak, as
there would be balance implications (since bringing up the hood makes
the whole cloak invisible, which you could skirt by just "zipping" it,
which also makes it invisible.~~

~~The sprites were already there, so this change was very simple to do.
Simply unties the zipped up look from the fact that the hood is up.
However, toggling the hood forces the zipping/unzipping, just so there's
no balance implications involved. It's just simpler that way.~~

So, I ended up going back and changing the sprites so that the hoods
would no longer be baked into the jacket's sprites, so that they could
be done as overlays instead, which ended up solving my problem with
hoods not being there on zipped-up versions.

For now, it's been made on winter coats only, but it shouldn't be that
difficult to bring it back down to the `/hooded` level. I just didn't
want to bother touching up the sprites down there, as it already took me
like 2-3 hours touching up the sprites of the winter coats alone.

I also took the decision to make it so EVA winter coats used the regular
winter coat's sprites, because they had special ones that just looked
like worse versions of the original, without anything special going on
for them. It was just a straight downgrade compared to the base sprite,
in my opinion.

There's still issues with the custom winter coat, in that the hood isn't
made into an overlay for it yet (and that'll require an extra bit of
logic to make it work, too), but it was already an issue before, the
hood is always present on the current version of the custom winter coat.

There's still a handful (sadly, most) of the winter coats that don't
properly reflect on their obj sprites when they're opened versus when
they're closed, but that's due to an initial spriter oversight, and not
to my doing. The open versions were just left as closed on many of them,
and I simply don't have the patience nor the appropriate skills to edit
that many coats that way.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Now you can be stylish with or without the hoodie!

According to ChatGPT, with one small tweak (thanks Opera GX for the
suggestion):

> Zipped and unzipped through alt-click, winter coats can now be. Hmm,
stylishly warm, you shall be. Feel like a Spaceman, you will. Use the
Force, to zip and unzip, you must. Look cool, you will. Yes, hmmm.

## Changelog

:cl: GoldenAlpharex, ChatGPT for the first changelog entry (slightly
edited)
qol: Zipped and unzipped through alt-click, winter coats can now be.
Hmm, stylishly warm, you shall be. Feel like a Spaceman, you will. Use
the Force, to zip and unzip, you must. Look cool, you will. Yes, hmmm.
image: Winter coats no longer have their hood baked into their jacket's
sprite, both in item form and when worn.
fix: Updated the Icebox EVA winter coats (the Endotherm winter coats) to
use the same sprites as the regular winter coats.

on my opinion, the new description describes the target audience
better than previous "those, who want to live their own lives".
The new description is easier to understand.

Old description:
"What is own life?" Do I want that "own life"?

New description:
You care about something important? - Yes, of course.
Do you want to care about that more pleasantly and efficiently? - Yes!

Utility charge eval (#735)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! â¥ï¸

ð¨ Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. ð¨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
Utility charge eval 

### Eval description
Given snippets from an electric utility bill, compute the per-kWh price
for electricity supply and delivery.

### What makes this a useful eval?
Utility bill parsing is needed to understand the breakdown of charges
and forecast future bills based on predicted usage. However, electricity
bills can be complex, with dozens of different line items that
contribute to the overall cost. This can be a headache for people
looking at their bill, as they just want to understand the per-kWh
prices for the supply/generation or delivery (e.g. transmission &
distribution) of their energy. Given incomplete but sufficient
information (e.g. simulating running OCR on a utility bill), this task
requires both the understanding and grouping of different terms and
charges under the delivery or supply, and basic arithmetic to compute
the total kWh and total charges in order to determine the per-kWh
prices. A human could fairly easily interpret the given data, but we
find that GPT3.5 (as well as GPT4 via the ChatGPT Plus) perform much
less accurately on the task (~.2).

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

All of the examples contain dummy values, but come from
terminology/formatting used in bills from many different utilities.

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist ð

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

preparing for these exams.
2. Language diversity: By focusing on Hindi, this evaluation set helps
to improve the AI's understanding and response generation in a
non-English language, catering to a large user base.
3. Subject matter: General science is an important topic covered in the
UPSC exams, and evaluating the AI's performance in this area will help
identify areas for improvement.
4. Logical reasoning and inference: **UPSC questions are known for
requiring logical reasoning and the ability to infer connections between
multiple topics**. By including questions that demand such skills, this
evaluation set will help test and improve the AI's ability to handle
complex, multi-layered problems.


## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This evaluation set is valuable for improving the AI's understanding of
Hindi and its ability to provide accurate answers to general science
questions in the context of UPSC exams, a widely recognized and
important examination in India. Moreover, by incorporating questions
that test logical reasoning and inference skills, it will help enhance
the AI's capability to handle complex, multi-faceted problems that
require connections between multiple topics.

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

Add Loss Logic Eval (#82)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! â¥ï¸

ð¨ Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. ð¨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4.

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
Loss Logic

### Eval description

A store bought a watermelon for $5 and sold it for a different price,
receiving counterfeit money in the transaction. They also had to give
change to the buyer. The net loss for the store varies based on the
specific details of the transaction.

### What makes this a useful eval?

* Tests comprehension and problem-solving skills: The scenarios provided
require the AI to understand and analyze the given information to
determine the net loss for the store.

* Addresses real-world situations: Counterfeit money transactions are a
real concern for businesses. This eval allows the AI to demonstrate its
understanding of financial transactions and the impact of counterfeit
money on a store's net loss.


## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [ ] Include at least 100 high quality examples

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

Involving the judgement of the truth or falsehood of real-world things,
which is a capability that GPT currently lacks.

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.jsonl`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist ð

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

store's net loss, we can consider the following steps: Assess the value
of the complimentary watermelon: Since the watermelon was given to the
store for free, it didn't cost them anything. Therefore, the store's
initial cost for the watermelon is $0. Calculate the revenue from
selling the watermelon: The store sold the watermelon for $7. However,
they received $10 in fake money, which has no value, so the actual
revenue is $0. Determine the cost of the change provided: Since the
store provided the buyer with $3 in change, this is an additional cost
to the store. Calculate the net loss: Subtract the revenue (Step 2) from
the sum of the initial cost (Step 1) and the cost of the change (Step
3). In this case: Net loss = (Initial cost + Cost of change) - Revenue

Eval: Probability Questions Sourced From Actuarial Exam P and University Statistics Courses (#263)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! â¥ï¸

ð¨ Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. ð¨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
Probability Questions

### Eval description

Tests the model's ability to understand answer probability questions.
Questions are sourced from Society of Actuaries Exam P sample questions
and practice problems/exams from statistics classes at MIT, UPenn,
California State University, Durham University, University of
Connecticut, and other sources. The full list of questions and sources
(in the same order as in the `.jsonl` files) can be found in this Google
[sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TU_4VPhIce9JtLV5gLy619WNibVjiWB-dtiwqkBtCrU/edit?usp=sharing)

### What makes this a useful eval?

Test the model's ability to understand worded probability questions,
bring in concepts such as probability distributions, and then reason
through a correct answer.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

Using the `match` grading criteria, GPT3.5-turbo got an accuracy score
of `{'accuracy': 0.07}`

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.jsonl`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist ð

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
AIME-Evaluation

### Eval description

This eval evaluates GPT on some selected AIME (American Invitational
Mathematics Examination) problems. This is a selective and prestigious
mathematical examination for high schoolers. All questions are selected
from the 2001 and 2002 AIME I and II examinations.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This evaluation combines math and logical evaluation and is designed to
be quite challenging. The model must first understand the math question
asked and then perform the math equations needed to come up with a
reasonable solution.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good

- [X] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

Our eval was designed to include both math and logical reasoning and is
quite challenging. This is a level above the AMC10 examination.

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.

Nepali song singer recognition (#892)

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
Nepali Song Singer

### Eval description

It tests the ability to understand Nepali language from given English
Transliteration phrase which is provided by user as a song title, and
checks the singer/band of the song. This eval has the accuracy of zero.
And, I still created this eval PR because I get the wrong answers every
time I ask, and I don't think that should be the case. It might not be
something that needs to be done immediately, but in a near future you
would expect your AI to answer it correctly.

### What makes this a useful eval?

If it can do for any English songs in the database, it should be able to
do for other languages as well. This is just a pattern I found it in my
mother tongue, but there might be different other languages where this
is happening as well, and it can be other things as well not just the
song title recognition.

#### Tuesday 2023-05-30 13:05:43 by Ghom

Adds a eye-dropper right-click function to the painting canvas. (#75571)

## About The Pull Request
Having used the painting UI to kill some time during long rounds for a
decent chunk of the past year, the need of a quicker and less tedious
way to fix a misclick or mistake like drawing over the wrong pixel has
become clear to me, as well as getting some feedback on the palette
component I made last year.

As the title suggests, this PR adds an eye-dropper function to the
canvas. Right-Click a pixel on the canvas, and the painting tool will
copy its color. Simple as, works on both finished and unfinished
paintings.

As a bonus, you can also right-click one of those selectable
white/colored squares on the color scheme near the bottom of the UI (if
using spraycan/palette) to change its color without having to go back to
main game window and a radial menu.

EDIT: With the tooltip added to the UI, I can say it's ready.

## Why It's Good For The Game
This PR aims to add better options to change colors on the go and
improve the user experience on the painting UI.

## Changelog

:cl:
qol: Adds a eye-dropper-like right-click function to the painting canvas
UI. Right-Click a pixel on the canvas while holding a painting tool to
have it copy its color.
qol: Also adds a right-click function to the color palette at the bottom
of the UI to allow users to set its colors without having to alternate
between the game window and the UI.
qol: Lastly, a tooltip has been added near the top-left corner of the
same UI to let players know of these features.

http: support CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS_STR

The CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS (and matching CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS) flag was
deprecated in curl 7.85.0, and using it generate compiler warnings as of
curl 7.87.0. The path forward is to use CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS_STR, but we
can't just do so unilaterally, as it was only introduced less than a
year ago in 7.85.0.

Until that version becomes ubiquitous, we have to either disable the
deprecation warning or conditionally use the "STR" variant on newer
versions of libcurl. This patch switches to the new variant, which is
nice for two reasons:

  - we don't have to worry that silencing curl's deprecation warnings
    might cause us to miss other more useful ones

  - we'd eventually want to move to the new variant anyway, so this gets
    us set up (albeit with some extra ugly boilerplate for the
    conditional)

There are a lot of ways to split up the two cases. One way would be to
abstract the storage type (strbuf versus a long), how to append
(strbuf_addstr vs bitwise OR), how to initialize, which CURLOPT to use,
and so on. But the resulting code looks pretty magical:

  GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE allowed = GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE_INIT;
  if (...http is allowed...)
	GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_APPEND(&allowed, "http", CURLOPT_HTTP);

and you end up with more "#define GIT_CURL_PROTOCOL_TYPE" macros than
actual code.

On the other end of the spectrum, we could just implement two separate
functions, one that handles a string list and one that handles bits. But
then we end up repeating our list of protocols (http, https, ftp, ftp).

This patch takes the middle ground. The run-time code is always there to
handle both types, and we just choose which one to feed to curl.

Eval Norwegian lexicon (#1044)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! â¥ï¸

ð¨ Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. ð¨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
`norwegian-lexicon`

### Eval description

This eval uses valid Norwegian words taken from the dictionary and
assesses whether GPT can recognize them as valid.

### What makes this a useful eval?

The Norwegian language is simple yet complicated at the same time. There
are a lot of words that are valid Norwegian words that do not get
recognized anymore. An AI should be able to identify these words with
precision. All of the words used in the samples are valid Norwegian
words and can be found in the dictionary. After assessing GPT-4 (through
the playground) and GPT-3.5 -- it failed to recognize most of the words.
Some of the words would return positive during some evals. Other times
it wouldn't recognize them. After asking GPT why it is not a valid word,
it would apologize and fix its mistake.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist ð

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
Internal representations via counting

### Eval description

Using series of logical questions that require multiple (simple)
manipulations of numbers to get the ideal answer. These are basic tasks
that should be doable by an LLM, but require several steps of internal
"thought" to get right.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Situations with number manipulation with multiple steps are prevalent
anywhere in the modern world. Testing the internal representation of the
LLM can provide other insights on how well its "mind" processes
information.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some

- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please

### Unique eval value

This eval is capable of providing insight into the LLM's internal
representation of objects versus answering fact-based questions or
straightforward complex logic puzzles.

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist ð

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Add eval: rhetorical-devices (#1005)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! â¥ï¸

ð¨ Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. ð¨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, pelase note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
rhetorical-devices

### Eval description

Evaluates model's ability to select the most specific rhetorical
modification of a sentence from a multiple choice with a large number of
nuanced rhetorical devices.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Useful for using LLMs to write novels and generate consistent/parametric
authorial tone.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

### Eval name
korean_spellings

### Eval description
Evaluates whether a given Korean word is spelled correctly or not with a
simple "Yes" or "No".

### What makes this a useful eval?
The samples are chosen from a set of frequently misspelled Korean words.
The words are specifically chosen because they are some of the most
frequently misspelled even by Korean native speakers. They are also
frequently used in day to day life.

The first 50 are the frequent misspelling of the word, and the last 50
are the same words but correctly spelled.

Drunk slurring scales based on how drunk you are (#75459)

## About The Pull Request

The strength of the slurring effect drunkness applies on you now scales
based on how drunk you are.

Being "a little" drunk still changes your saymod, and makes you
occasionally slur your words...


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/51863163/1b21b359-a1f9-428a-8e10-d2028ac59728)

But being "a lot" drunk kicks it up to 11


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/51863163/9d593c80-75ff-4d02-8e7c-e48c738154bb)

Additionally, drunk slurring was separated into "generic slurring" and
"drunk slurring", the former which does not scale but less closely
resembles drunkness. Generic slurring is used in places such as
concussions, so this is an added bonus.

As a result of the split, I had to update mind restoration. Now it heals
all types of slurring, which does include cult slurs.

## Why It's Good For The Game

I, and many other people, always found it very annoying when you became
completely illegible from taking one sip of a drink. This seeks to amend
that by making low levels of drunkness still for the most part be
legible and sane. Average drunkness is roughly the same / equal to the
old slurring effect, while "very drunk" is even more illegible and silly
(which I find funny).

This has the added bonus of separating out "drunk slurring" and "generic
slurring", allowing effects to slur your words without going full ham on
drunkness (burping and "huhh"s).

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
add: When you are drunk, the strength of your slurring now varies based
on how drunk you are. Being "a little drunk" only rarely slurs your
words, being average drunk is the same as the old effect, while being
very drunk now slurs your words even more.
add: Some non-alcohol sources of slurring, such as concussions, now give
"generic slurring" rather than "drunk slurring", which less resemble
being drunk (ie, no burping).
add: Mind restoration now heals ALL slurring, rather than only drunk
slurring (which includes cult / heretic slurring).

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
simple-visual-understanding

### Eval description

This evaluation tests whether the model is capable of emerging very 
simple visual representations of the world as well as understanding
simple
concepts used in everyday language like U turn, L shape etc.  


### What makes this a useful eval?

Human reasoning and intelligence are very tied to visual representations
we build of the world. In the quest to better understand and communicate
with us, it is important for an AI to grasp the same models of the world
we have. Common everyday language refers to things like U turn, L shape
etc
so assessing whether the model actually understands these shapes is
important.

It is of course understandable that an LLM that has never actually seen 
anything can't really understand visual aspects of our world but these 
very simple tests try to assess whether a model has been able to emerge 
such capabilities from written language.

It is interesting to see that GPT actually passes a few tests,
indicating
that some rudimentary visual representation has already emerged. 
Nevertheless, it fails most of the tests indicating there's still work
to be done.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good

particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [X] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.

either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [X] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

These evals have been built from scratch to minimize the possibility of
previous training data helping the model to solve the
problems without actually understanding the meaning of them.

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should

Eval: Seating Arrangement (#982)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! â¥ï¸

ð¨ Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. ð¨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, pelase note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
Seating Arrangements

### Eval description

An array of seating arrangement constraints, each with 2 solutions.
Examining the models spatial reasoning abilities.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Assists with evaluating simple spatial reasoning with a limited number
of solutions to a constraint problem. I created a solver to ensure that
each puzzle only has 2 solutions and a limited number of variables. A
human should be able to solve these extremely easily even without
writing the names down on pen and paper.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

[Eval] Resolving ambiguous sentences (#889)

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
Ambiguous Sentences (`ambiguous-sentences`)

### Eval description
Resolves ambiguous questions of sentence pairs. Examples are taken from
the Winograd Schema Challenge. The challenge involves a pair of
sentences that differ in only one or two words, and the machine is
required to determine the correct meaning of a pronoun in the sentence.

### What makes this a useful eval?
It is pointed out that GPT is still often thrown off by these types of
questions, providing one answer upon the first request, and it often
changes if the request is regenerated with a different result
`(0.7666666666666667)`.

I think it is worth including as an example to others viewing the
repository who are trying to understand what kind of logic GPT tends to
fail with, even if some of this data has already been trained on.
Provides a place to insert similar types of ambiguous sentence/question
pairs as they are discovered.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,

### Unique eval value

(Not required)
- Handpicked specific prompts from the challenge that I have noticed
have mixed results consistently.
- Ensure that matching prompts are next to each other for easy
comparison for humans in the `.jsonl` file.

[Evals] Add Nutrition Facts (#853)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! â¥ï¸

ð¨ Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. ð¨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
nutrition

### Eval description

Test the model's nutritional accuracy, providing machine parsable and
accurate responses using metric notation when asked about specific
values.

### What makes this a useful eval?

The task of populating a spreadsheet with information based on facts
from adjacent cells that contain inquiries and details is currently a
manual task and can be time consuming and prone to errors. Using a
natural language parser and language model like GPT can automate the
process and save time. Filling in missing details from adjacent
spreadsheet cells containing natural language would be useful in
automating the process of populating a spreadsheet with data based on
nutritional facts and inventory in our case. This would save time and
effort for staff, who would otherwise have to manually enter data.

In the case where we were assisting one of our customers, Google
Spreadsheets was used as the tool to store and manage the data related
to nutritional facts and inventory. The idea was to use a natural
language parser and language model like GPT to extract the intention of
a spreadsheet cell and provide the following cell with the desired
information based on the data stored in Google Spreadsheets.

However, the accuracy of the information provided by the language model
were not reliable, and the desired results could not be achieved. We had
to approach the problem with a combination of manual and scripting. More
work needs to be done to improve the accuracy and reliability of
language models like GPT when integrated with tools like Google
Spreadsheets.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

The model mostly answers in the desired format, yet usually got it
wrong.

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist ð

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

Update README.md

The WordPair Generator app is a unique and innovative tool designed to inspire creativity and generate new ideas by combining two random words to create interesting word pairs. It harnesses the power of artificial intelligence and natural language processing to provide users with an endless stream of unexpected word combinations.

The app's interface is user-friendly and intuitive, allowing users to easily navigate and interact with the various features. Upon launching the app, users are greeted with a clean and visually appealing design, creating an enjoyable experience.

The WordPair Generator app offers multiple modes to suit different creative needs. In the "Quick Pair" mode, users can simply tap a button to instantly generate a random word pair. This mode is perfect for spontaneous brainstorming sessions or when a quick burst of inspiration is needed.

For users looking for more specific word combinations, the app provides a "Custom Pair" mode. In this mode, users can input their own keywords or select from predefined categories to narrow down the type of words they want to generate. For example, users may choose categories such as "Nature," "Technology," or "Food" to focus the word pairings on those specific themes.

The app also features a "Favorites" section where users can save and revisit their favorite word pairs. This allows users to build a personalized collection of creative sparks that they can refer to later when working on writing projects, brainstorming ideas for business names, or simply for the joy of discovering intriguing word combinations.

Moreover, the WordPair Generator app offers additional features to enhance the creative process. It includes a sharing option that enables users to share their favorite word pairs directly with friends or colleagues via social media platforms or messaging apps. This facilitates collaboration and sparks conversations around the generated ideas.

With regular updates and expansions to its word database, the WordPair Generator app ensures a constant influx of fresh and diverse word pairings, keeping users engaged and continuously inspired.

In summary, the WordPair Generator app is a dynamic tool that utilizes AI to generate unique word combinations, fostering creativity, and offering a valuable resource for writers, marketers, designers, and anyone seeking inspiration for their projects.

feat: scroll to def when its name is clicked in the sidebar

This approach is a bit hacky, but we couldn't think of a better way to
do this without wrapping large chunks of `App` in a
`ReactFlowProvider`, which we weren't crazy about. (However, that
approach may become less objectionable/problematic once we've broken
the live eval and definition list out of the sidebar.)

We'd prefer to pass the def's `GlobalName` to the `TreeReactFlow`
callback, but this would require quite a bit of reworking of the
sidebar's definition list. As that component is probably not long for
this world, we'll defer this work until later when we figure out
exactly where the definition list will go.

Limitations of this current implementation:

* It doesn't change the zoom level and technically only focuses on the
definition's root node, without trying to fit its entire tree on the
screen. We should probably support this, perhaps through some sort of
double-click/double-touch mechanism.

* It only works for definitions the student has defined in the current
module. It doesn't work for imported definitions, and it doesn't work
for typedefs, as those aren't yet rendered on the canvas. However,
this feature should be relatively easy to adapt to student-defined
typedefs once they're represented as trees on the canvas.

* It's not yet implemented in the live eval view. It may be useful for
fitting the tree on the screen when we switch which definition is
being evaluated, but there may be easier/better ways to do this that
don't involve the convoluted callback mechanism we've had to implement
here, because all of the controls we need are in a monolithic
component. We'll explore this in subsequent work, in any case.

i have no idea why this decided to throw a compile error now? wtf?

my wild-ass guess is this is somehow related to the serde dependency
being included now, but who the fuck knows. what a joke.

Makes Hell Microwaves Not Use Power (#67413) (#21210)

Hey there,

I was informed that the holodeck program Microwave Paradise would draw and suck power out of an APC. Didn't intend for that to happen, and while funny, I don't really want to arm the crew with le epic power sink with very little effort than pressing a button, or warranting this to eventually be locked to "dangerous" programs. So, let's change such that this subtype of microwaves that can not be constructed (only mapped/spawned) doesn't consume any power. I don't know why it drew off the nearest APC or how that works, but this seems to be alright.

It's not possible to deconstruct machinery spawned in at the Holodeck (which I verified while testing this PR), so do not worry about people using this to bypass the power economy for whzhzhzhz purposes.

Upgrade react-range to fix memory usage of sliders

As mentioned in
https://blog.streamlit.io/six-tips-for-improving-your-streamlit-app-performance/
memory usage struggles in the browser if you have large ranges:

> Due to implementation details, high-cardinality sliders don't suffer
> from the serialization and network transfer delays mentioned earlier,
> but they will still lead to a poor user experience (who needs to
> specify house prices up to the dollar?) and high memory usage. In my
> testing, the example above increased RAM usage by gigabytes until the
> web browser eventually gave up (though this is something that should
> be solvable on our end. We'll look into it!)

This was caused by a bug in react-range, which I fixed last year.
https://github.com/tajo/react-range/pull/178

At the time, I had figured it would get picked up by a random yarn
upgrade and didn't worry too much about it.
But, apparently yarn doesn't really have an easy way of doing upgrades
of transitive dependencies (see https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/4986)?
I took the suggestion of someone in that thread to delete the entry and
let yarn regenerate it.

Some techinical details about the react-range fix from the original
commit message (the "application" is a streamlit app):

> We have an application that uses react-range under the hood, and we
> noticed that a range input was taking 2GB of RAM on our machines. I
> did some investigation and found that regardless of whether the marks
> functionality was being used, refs were being created for each
> possible value of the range.

> We have some fairly huge ranges (we're using the input to scrub a
> video with potential microsecond accuracy), and can imagine that
> other people are affected by the previous behavior. This change
> should allow us to continue using large input ranges without
> incurring a memory penalty.
