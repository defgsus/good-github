Adds the DNA Infuser, a genetics machine you feed corpses to infuse their DNA with yours! What could go wrong?! (#71351)

## About The Pull Request  
Adds the "DNA Infuser" to genetics. One person enters, a corpse is added
to the machine, and you can activate the machine to "infuse" the subject
with the DNA. This converts one random organ from a set into the
mob-related organ.

### Rat mutation üêÄ

Rats can be fed in to turn you into a rat-creature-thing!
```diff
+See better in the dark
+Can pretty much eat anything! Toxic foods, gross foods, whatever works!
+Smaller, and can climb tables
?Randomly squeaks occasionally?
-Take twice as much damage
-Vulnerable to flashes
-Gets hungry MUCH quicker.
-Yes, eat anything, but only ENJOY dairy.
```
Having every rat organ at once allows you to ventcrawl nude!

### Carp mutation üêü 

Carp work for a mutation as well!
```diff
+Strong jaws, that drop teeth over time!
+Space immunity! Breathe in space, unbothered by pressure or cold!
+Smaller, and can climb tables
-Can't block your jaws with a mask
-Can't take the heat, overheats easily
-Can only breathe in environments that have minimal or no oxygen
-Nomadic. If you don't enter a new zlevel for awhile, you'll start feeling anxious.
```
Having every carp organ at once allows you to swim through space!

### Fly mutation ü™∞ 

Any corpses without organs to turn into turn into fly organs! Fly organs
now have a bonus for collecting them all, transforming you into a fly,
when you pass the threshold. But even without those, fly organs are
technically... organs. They most of the time work like normal ones.

## Todo üê¶ 

- [x] Finish the infuser code
- [x] Create a little booklet that shows what kind of shit you can turn
into, hopefully i can autogenerate this based off of organ set subtypes
list
- [x] sprite/slap a color on rat mutant organs
- [x] Maybe make a *few* more organ sets

## Why It's Good For The Game üêë

Psykers (#71566)

## About The Pull Request
Finishes #66471
At burden level nine (or through a deadly genetic breakdown), you now
turn into a psyker.
This splits your skull in half and transforms it into a weird fleshy
mass. You become blind, but your skull is perfectly suited for sending
out psychic waves. You get potent psy abilities.
First one is brainwave echolocation, inspired by Gehennites (but not as
laggy).
Secondly, you get the ability of Psychic Walls, which act similarly to
wizard ones, but last shorter, and cause projectiles to ricochet off
them.
Thirdly, you get a projectile boost ability, this temporarily lets you
fire guns twice as fast and gives them homing to the target you clicked.
Lastly, you get the ability of psychic projection. This terrifies the
victim, fucking their screen up and causing them to rapidfire any gun
they have in their general direction (they'll probably miss you)
With most of the abilities being based around guns, a burden level nine
chaplain now gets a new rite, Transmogrify. This lets them turn their
null rod into a 5-shot 18 damage .77 revolver. The revolver possesses a
weaker version of antimagic (protects against mind and unholy spells,
but not wizard/cult ones). It is reloaded by a prayer action (can also
only be performed by a max burdened person).

## Why It's Good For The Game
Rewards the burdened chaplain with some pretty cool stuff for going
through hell like losing half his limbs, cause the current psychics dont
cut it as much as probably necessary, adds echolocation which can be
used for neat stuff in the future (bat organs for DNA infuser for
example).

## Changelog
:cl: Fikou, sprites from Halcyon, some old code from Basilman and
Armhulen.
refactor: Honorbound and Burdened mutations are brain traumas now.
add: Psykers. Become a psyker through the path of the burdened, or a
genetic breakdown.
add: Echolocation Component.

Add note about EOL packages (#7216)

There's been some apparent confusion around what EOL means for AS 2/3.
Concerned folks seem to be under the impression that they need to
migrate away immediately as if the software is going to disappear out
from under them, so we should make it clear that's not the case, even if
we recommend strongly against using EOL software.

Merge #92713 #92783 #92859

92713: sql: fix left semi and left anti virtual lookup joins r=yuzefovich a=yuzefovich

This commit fixes the execution of the left semi and left anti virtual
lookup joins. The bug was that we forgot to project away the looked up
columns (coming from the "right" side) which could then lead to wrong
columns being used higher up the tree. The bug was introduced during
22.1 release cycle where we added the optimizer support for generating
plans that could contain left semi and left anti virtual lookup joins.
This commit fixes that issue as well as the output columns of such joins
(I'm not sure whether there is a user facing impact of having incorrect
"output columns").

Additionally, this commit fixes the execution of these virtual lookup
joins to correctly return the input row only once. Previously, for left
anti joins we'd be producing an output row if there was a match (which
is wrong), and for both left semi and left anti we would emit an output
row every time there was a match (but this should be done only once).
(Although I'm not sure whether it is possible for virtual indexes to
result in multiple looked up rows.)

Also, as a minor simplification this commit makes it so that the output
rows are not added into the row container for left semi and left anti
and the container is not instantiated at all.

Fixes: #91012.
Fixes: #88096.

Release note (bug fix): CockroachDB previously could incorrectly
evaluate queries that performed left semi and left anti "virtual lookup"
joins on tables in `pg_catalog` or `information_schema`. These join types
can be planned when a subquery is used inside of a filter condition. The
bug was introduced in 22.1.0 and is now fixed.

92783: nogo: detect deprecated go standard library packages r=rickystewart a=healthy-pod

In #87327, we patched `staticcheck` to detect deprecated "objects" from the standard library. This patch ensures that we also detect deprecated "packages".

Closes #84877

Release note: None

92859: rowcontainer: address an old TODO r=yuzefovich a=yuzefovich

This commit addresses an old TODO about figuring out why we cannot reuse the same buffer in `diskRowIterator.Row` method. The contract of that method was previously confusing - it says that the call to `Row` invalidates the row returned on the previous call; however, the important piece was missing - that the datums themselves cannot be mutated (this is what we assume elsewhere and perform only the "shallow" copies). This commit clarifies the contract of the method and explicitly explains why we need to allocate fresh byte slices (which is done via `ByteAllocator` to reduce the number of allocations).

Additional context can be found in #43145 which added this copy in the first place. Here is a relevant quote from Alfonso:
```
I think what's going on here is that this type of contract (you may only
reuse the row until the next call) is a bit unclear. `CopyRow`s of
`EncDatum`s are only implemented as shallow copies, so the reference to
this reuse only applies to the `EncDatumRow`, but not to the `encoded`
field, which is what is rewritten in this case. The `encoded` field will
not be copied, so I think the tests are probably failing due to that.
This is unfortunate and there doesn't seem to be a good reason for it.
To implement deep copies, we will have to implement deep copies for
`Datum`s as well.
```
I think we were under the impression that we'd implement the "deep copy" in `CopyRow`, but I highly doubt we'll do so given that we're mostly investing in the columnar infrastructure nowadays, and the current way of performing shallow copying has worked well long enough.

Epic: None

Release note: None

[MIRROR] Create a guide for atomization that includes a new allowance to pull requests that might add dead code [MDB IGNORE] (#17839)

* Create a guide for atomization that includes a new allowance to pull requests that might add dead code (#71429)

@ tgstation/commit-access

I'm proposing a new use for the Atomic tag that we currently virtually
never use.

We have countless pull requests over time, and plenty of which open now,
that are enormous refactors over tens of files with thousands of
additions. We are historically pretty slow to review and merge these,
and it definitely scares a lot of maintainers off. I think part of the
reason is that we do not like dead code being added, which is completely
reasonable at our scale.

However, I propose that, for refactors/purely code stuff, we ease up on
this a lot, and encourage (not require) people to make smaller pull
requests, even to the extent that it creates APIs we do not use yet.

As an example, https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/71421 does a
massive refactor to carp. It also does some balance changes, which I
think we could agree could be split off if it was enough of a pain.
However, there's a bunch of other stuff that could have been individual
pull requests here with this new allowance.

- The new basic AI behaviors
- The regenerator component
- Pet commands component

These are things that:

- Would not be used until the transition from simple to basic, but are
easily reviewable on their own
- Are easy to REMOVE if the OP does not follow up
- Are easy to FINISH if the OP does not follow up

(I suspect even, for instance, that there are parts of Wallening we
could be merging right now, that's probably gonna be hundreds or
thousands of files long...)

Pros:
- PRs are more often easily reviewable
- PRs are quicker to merge, since we don't have conflicts from editing
one of the 70 files they changed
- Cleanups can be more easily finished by other people. I don't suspect
this will be likely, but it's not easily possible today

Cons:
- We have to mark the PRs as atomic
- Someone needs to look through every so often (I'm thinking like, once
a month or something) to see if the code ended up being used, or if the
committer still plans to use it
- If the PR is adding a complex enough API that isn't modular, it might
be very hard to remove. I suspect for PRs like this that we ask them to
have an implementer before merging.

NL voice would love your thoughts on this

Brimdemons & Lobstrosities drop (slightly) useful organs (#70546)



Goliaths, Legions, Watchers, and (as of recently) Bileworms all drop
something vaguely useful when they die.
Brimdemons and Lobstrosities do not. This PR aims to fix that, so that
there's at least some vague benefit to hunting them.

In this case it takes the form of organs you get when you butcher them,
similar to the regenerative core from Legions.
As they're similar to the regenerative core, I modified the regenerative
core to extend from a new common "monster core" typepath which these two
new organs also extend.
Like the regenerative core, both of these items do something when used
and something slightly different if you go to the effort of having
someone implant them into your body. They also decay over time, and you
can use stabilising serum to prevent this from happening.


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/195967746-55a7d04d-224e-412d-aedc-3a0ec754db3d.mp4

The Rush Gland from the Lobstrosity lets you do a little impression of
their charging attack, making you run very fast for a handful of seconds
and ignoring slowdown effects. Unlike a lobstrosity you aren't actually
built to do this so if you run into a mob you will fall over, and if you
are doing this on the space station running into any dense object will
also make you fall over (it shouldn't make you _too_ much of a pain for
security to catch).
The idea here is that you use this to save time running back and forth
from the mining base.

The Brimdust Sac from the Brimdemon covers you in exploding dust. The
next three times you take Brute damage some of the dust will explode,
dealing damage equal to an unupgraded PKA shot to anything near you (but
not you).
If you do this in a space station not only is the damage proportionally
lower (still matching the PKA), but it _does_ effect you and also it
sets you on fire. You can remove the buff by showering it off.
The idea here is that you use this for minor revenge damage on enemies
whose attacks you don't manage to dodge.


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/195967811-0b362ba9-2da0-42ac-bd55-3809473cbc74.mp4

If you implant the Rush Gland then you can use it once every 3 minutes
without consuming it, and the buff lasts very slightly longer. It will
automatically trigger itself if your health gets low, which might be
good (helps you escape a rough situation) or bad (didn't want to use it
yet).


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7483112/195967888-f63f7cbd-60cd-4309-8004-203afc5b2153.mp4

If you implant the Brimdust Sac then you can use it once every 3 minutes
to shake off cloud of dust which gives the buff to everyone nearby, if
you want to kit out your miner squad. The dust cloud also makes you
cough if you stand in it, and it's opaque. If you catch fire with this
organ inside you and aren't in mining atmosphere then it will explode
inside of your abdomen, which should probably be avoided, resultingly it
is very risky to use this on the space station.

Made geysers easier to find (#71608)

## About The Pull Request

This PR raises the geyser spawn rate from 0.1 to 0.15 and increases the
weight of wittel geysers to 10 which is the same as every other special
geyser. (previously 6)

Wittel shouldn't be any less difficult to find than other geysers as all
of the special geysers are equally powerful. Hyper-plasmium oxide can be
used to make extremely powerful explosives that can go beyond maxcaps
and hollow water + protozine can create an infinite amount of strange
reagent.

I've subjected myself to going out of my way to visit lavaland/icemoon
several times to get wittel and each time finding a single geyser takes
about 5 minutes of my time. This, coupled with the fact you really don't
have a lot of time to be wasting on looking for the geysers results in
an unfun experience.

I understand geysers are sort of a necessary evil, however, they
shouldn't be THIS difficult to find. Out of the 10 or so geysers I've
found, only 1 has had wittel in it and it was next to a whelp portal
which ended both me and my miner escort.

I've also hunted the entirety of lavaland with no luck. (Horrendous
experience.)

I've dedicated entire rounds to this, by the way.
## Why It's Good For The Game

If you go out of your way to waste ages hunting for geysers, there
should at least be a reward. That is, in the same round, not after 3 or
more rounds as even megafauna gear isn't gatekept THAT hard.

You shouldn't have to waste this much of a miner's time (who is also
going for megafauna gear) to get something that is arguably less
powerful than what they get for less effort. Megafauna gear is also
available every round and is attained via predictable methods.

This PR will also likely make geyser scanning a more comparable method
of point gain to just mining.

Oh and not to mention that penthrite is available almost roundstart via
luxpens. (It's a wittel chem.)
## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Geysers now spawn more often, especially wittel geysers.

[IMP] forwardport: gc/maintenance of local repo caches

The current system makes / lets GC run during fetching. This has a few
issues:

- the autogc consumes resources during the forward-porting
  process (not that it's hugely urgent but it seems unnecessary)
- the autogc commonly fails due to the combination of large repository
  (odoo/odoo) and low memory limits (hardmem for odoo, which get
  translated into soft ulimits)

As a result, the garbage collection of the repository sometimes stops
entirely, leading to an increase in repository size and a decrease in
performances.

To mitigate this issue, disable the automagic gc and maintenance
during normal operation, and instead add a weekly cron which runs an
aggressive GC with memory limits disabled (as far as they can get, if
the limits are imposed externally there's nothing to be done).

The maintenance is implemented using a full lockout of the
forward-port cron and an in-place GC rather than a copy/gc/swap, as
doing this maintenance at the small hours of the week-end (sat-sun
night) seems like a non-issue: currently an aggressive GC of odoo/odoo
(using the default aggressive options) takes a total of 2:30 wallclock
(5h user) on a fairly elderly machine (it's closer to 20mn wallclock
and 2h user on my local machine, also turns out the cache repos are
kinda badly configured leading to ~30% more objects than necessary
which doesn't help).

For the record, a fresh checkout of odoo/odoo right now yields:

    | Overall repository size      |           |
    | * Commits                    |           |
    |   * Count                    |   199 k   |
    |   * Total size               |   102 MiB |
    | * Trees                      |           |
    |   * Count                    |  1.60 M   |
    |   * Total size               |  2.67 GiB |
    |   * Total tree entries       |  74.1 M   |
    | * Blobs                      |           |
    |   * Count                    |  1.69 M   |
    |   * Total size               |  72.4 GiB |

If this still proves insufficient, a further option would be to deploy
a "generational repacking" strategy:
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/2861 (though apparently
it's not yet been implemented / deployed on gitlab so...).

But for now we'll see how it shakes out.

Biogen Refactor and Code Cleanup, Faster Biomass Conversion and No More Biomass Cap! (#71563)

## About The Pull Request
So, I looked at the Biogenerator code and there was just, _so_ much old
and undocumented code, that I just spazzed out and started documenting
and refactoring everything. There's now a lot less usage of contents
lookups and for loops, and _almost_ everything is documented, now, too.

As for the changes, as you can see in the title, I made biomass
conversion faster. How much faster, you ask? 5 times faster with default
parts, up to 20 times faster with the best parts. It was painfully slow,
and that's not fun for anyone.

I also lifted the biomass cap. It wasn't useful, it wasn't fun, and
Melbert didn't really agree with it either. However, I enjoyed the look
of the biomass going up, so I gave it a max visual amount of 5000, so
you get to see it gradually filling up as you put your first 5000
biomass in. After that, you do you, chief. Watch the funny numbers go up
all you want.

I also improved the maths so that it wasn't just rounding stuff
constantly, and also gave a little bit more insight on how much biomass
everything would cost you, down to two decimals. If there's no decimals,
it won't show them, however.


<details>
<summary>Here's what that looks like now:</summary>
That's one screenshot per different decimal places, there's no trailing
zeros because I think we can all universally agree that those look bad
in this kind of setting.

</details>

There's now also more information displayed when you examine the biogen,
namely, how many items it has stored, and how many it can hold. I also
fixed the formatting a bit, so it looks ever so slightly cleaner.

Other than that, I just improved the code everywhere I saw it to be
fitting, there shouldn't be any single-letter variables in there
anymore, and the code should be more spaced out. Honestly, at this
point, I wrote most of this code six hours ago so I don't remember all
of it, and I'm too lazy to go through and check what I've changed again.
Diff and changelog are there for that.

## Why It's Good For The Game
So, I'll be honest, there were two big reasons that motivated me to do
this. First of all, the biomass cap. That was a little silly, anyone
that has spent more than one shift in Hydroponics knows that you usually
only put Watermelons in the biomass generator as they're usually the
thing that nets you the most biomass. Botanists will generally stock the
fridges first, and if they have a lot of excess, they'll put it in the
generator if they want, but that's rarely what was done. I've talked
with @MrMelbert about it and he gave me the go-ahead, as can be seen
here:


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58045821/204115174-fb2610c0-61c5-44e1-845e-cc6925ee33e6.png)

The other reason was the excruciatingly slow processing speed, which
I've fixed. So we're good now. :)

## Changelog

:cl: GoldenAlpharex
refactor: Went through and refactored a lot of the old code of the
biogenerator, and made multiple improvements to its logic, which should
hopefully make it behave more consistently. Nearly all of it is now also
fully documented, so as to make it easier for anyone else that has to
sift through it in the future.
qol: The biogenerator now processes items five times faster, up to 20
times faster if properly upgraded!
qol: The biogenerator is no longer capped on biomass. Its visuals will
change up until 5000 biomass, but you're free to go as high as you'd
like with it! Sky's the limit!
fix: Fixed the logic of the biogenerator that would make it so the
amount of biomass used for recipes was wildly inconsistent. Now, there's
no more back-end rounding up, it's all on the front end when it needs to
be, so there's no loss or gain of biomass when there shouldn't be.
spellcheck: Fixed a capitalization issue with the seaweed sheets in the
biogenerator recipes.
spellcheck: Fixed multiple inconsistencies between the messages sent to
your chat by the biogenerator.

Removes tablets (not PDAs) entirely. (#71507)

## About The Pull Request

**Comes with an UpdatePaths!**

Removes the tablet subtype, PDAs now replaces them entirely.

Nukie and Silicon tablets are now subtypes of the PDA instead, while
contractor ones were removed entirely as they didn't do anything and
were unused (though it wouldn't be hard to re-add).

Nukie PDAs are now the only type of PDA that uses modular_tablets.dmi,
which is just larger icons of modular_pda. Each application requires an
icon state in both of these, for 2 different sizes, which makes it
annoying to make new applications, especially if it can also run on
computers/laptops.

### Icons

Because Silicon tablets are now a subtype of PDA, they use PDA icons
instead of tablet ones. Luckily for us, they already exist in code.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53777086/203876575-56eb1593-774c-47c6-8e7d-491a7805f28c.png)

AI's don't use a tablet icon though, so they aren't affected.

## Why It's Good For The Game

There's very little difference between tablets and PDAs, PDAs overshadow
them in every single way, so at this point I don't see why we should
have both of these, and if you compare the two in usefulness and actual
in-game use by players, it's a no-brainer than the item all players get
roundstart and comes with a messenger should be the one we go with.

Also as said in the about section, when making an app you would need to
make icon states for the program running for all hardware it can run on,
which is Computer, Laptop, PDA, and Tablet.

Laptop is just a smaller computer icon
PDA is just a smaller tablet icon

However, you can't simply shrink the size of the icon, instead you have
to completely resprite the same app icon FOUR TIMES for it to not
bluescreen on all these different devices.

<details>
<summary>
Here's examples of it
</summary>
Computer (NOTE: *They share the same icon file as regular computers*)

</details>

If we wish to help in simplifying this, we should remove tablet icons
entirely, which means 1 less icon to worry about. To do this, we'd need
to resprite nukie PDAs, however I am very much not a spriter and never
tried GAGS, so I'll leave it to someone else to do.

## Changelog

:cl:
del: Tablets are now removed, PDAs are now the base 'tablet'. Silicon
and nukie tablets are now PDAs.

Changes Admin Prison to be Anti-Telekinesis: Walls off equipment rooms, replaces computers, and makes the tables tidy (#71433)

First PR, may require some changes or something because I don't know how
to do anything bleh
## About The Pull Request

We already had issues with crewmembers with telekinesis making changes
to the security records (purging them and what not). And, nothing has
been done about it, not yet, anyway. Not only record computers are a
problem as well.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106710384/203241399-8314bcba-d2d0-44af-9360-30ff58dbc39e.png)
Previously, prisoners can access the sec vendor with telepathy, and,
since the vendor is free, spam the vendor and be an annoyance. Sure, I
believe that it is not as big of a problem as purging the security
records, but I feel like it's against what the prison is supposed to
stand for; It's supposed to stop them and get them to listen to ahelps
thrown at them.

I've decided to make a bit of changes to the prison to make it so that
people with telekinesis won't fuck up things as much. This replaces real
computers with nonfunctional ones, adding walls to equipment areas to
make sure prisoners don't spam the vendor, and deletes guns/weapons from
the tables so they won't grab them.

## Why It's Good For The Game


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106710384/203241465-833f79da-58a3-4feb-87b0-091fbb846e93.png)
This PR is more tailored to admins dealing with no-good-doers, and goes
for the vibe of "HEY, SOMEONE IS PMING YOU, REPLY TO THEM INSTEAD!" Of
course, this leads to prisoners not interacting with the current round,
and, less chance of them going insane and breaking all the windows with
a telekinesis auto-rifle.

Plus, this can always be reverted in-case someone comes up with coding
stuff in instead. I'm all through with that and willing to work with
whoever to solve the issue.

Also, of course, Closes #60967

## Changelog

:cl:
admin: Nanotrashen made some top-of-the-line changes to their
top-of-the-line prison by walling off their equipment area and removing
some spare guns they somehow left on the tables. We also stole the
security computers, so people with telekinesis can't access them.

Basic Mob Carp Bonus Part: Wall smashing (#71524)

## About The Pull Request

Atomisation of #71421 
This moves the attack function of "environment smash" flags which allow
simple mobs to attack walls into an element, so that we can put it on
other things later.
For some reason while working on carp I convinced myself that they had
"environment_smash" flags, which they do not, so this actually is not
relevant to carp in any way.

While implementing this I learned that the way wall smashing works is
stupid, because walls don't have health and so resultingly if a mob can
attack walls it deletes them in a single click. If we ever decide to
change this then it should be easier in an element than in three
different `attack_animal` reactions.
This is especially silly with the "wumborian fugu" item which allows any
mob it is used on to instantly delete reinforced walls, and also to
destroy tables if they click them like seven or eight times (because it
does not increase their object damage in any way).

## Why It's Good For The Game

Eventually someone will port a basic mob which does use this behaviour
(most of the mining ones for instance) and then this will be useful.
If we ever rebalance wall smashing to not instantly delete walls then
this will also be useful.
Admins can apply this to a mob to allow it to delete walls if they
wanted to do that for some reason, they probably shouldn't to be honest
at least until after we've done point two unless they trust the player
not to just use it to deconstruct the space station.

## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: Moves wall smashing out of simple mob code and into an element
we can reuse for basic mobs later

[FIX] website, *: allow to re-edit company team snippet images

*: website_sale

Since [1], it was not possible to edit a company team snippet image
anymore as soon as the page was saved once. Indeed that commit added
o_not_editable/contenteditable="false" on the parent column to make sure
no text can be added in that column and contenteditable="true" on the
images so that they are still editable (even though HTML-specs-wise
adding contenteditable="true" on images probably does not mean much as
images are self-closing tags, our editor understand that as the ability
to edit the image anyway). That contenteditable="true" part is however
removed when leaving edit mode... and was not restored upon entering
edit mode again.

This fixes the problems with a specific JS patch, we'll review to see if
better can be done in master.

Funny enough, that bug was actually gone in 15.0... by mistake. A recent
bug fix actually reintroduced that isolated bug at [2] (by reintroducing
the fact that images in a non-editable environment are not possible to
edit). The 3 opened tickets this commit mentions were actually reported
for 15.0 immediately after that, while the 14.0 being broken about this
since the beginning apparently did not bother anyone.

Note: as a forward-ported fix, this also takes the opportunity to clean
a bit what was done at [3]. (calling `_super`, no duplicated code,
adding comments, ...).

commit: give a hint when a commit message has been abandoned

If we launch an editor for the user to create a commit
message, they may put significant work into doing so.
Typically we try to check common mistakes that could cause
the commit to fail early, so that we die before the user
goes to the trouble.

We may still experience some errors afterwards, though; in
this case, the user is given no hint that their commit
message has been saved. Let's tell them where it is.

ahead-behind: do not die when we see no INTERESTING pending object

We currently die if we are fed an ahead/behind with zero
objects (`foo..foo` in the most basic case, but in practice
something like `foo@{upstream}..foo`, when `foo` has just
been merged).  The problem is that we let
`handle_revision_arg` parse it, and then pick the pieces out
of the pending object list. So "^foo" looks no different to
us there than "foo".

This patch hacks around it by picking up the UNINTERESTING
object in that case. However, this isn't great because:

  1. Now we won't notice some types of bogus input.

  2. We end up reporting the name of the UNINTERESTING object.

We probably should pick apart the ".." ourselves, or even
just change it to ":" or whitespace.

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

Hotkey-based inventory management now applies the click cooldown to prevent it from being abusable in combat scenarios. (#71325)


About The Pull Request

Hotkey-based inventory management now applies the click cooldown to prevent it from being abusable in combat scenarios.
Why It's Good For The Game

Players have been deploying unbelievable levels of abuse with these hotkeys having completely uncapped speeds.
I watched one cheater do automated inventory management using storage items and weirdly named empty pills to use as inventory delimiters.
Resolves people being able to have a baton hidden in their backpack and then activate and baton someone with it in 0.1 seconds without moving their mouse cursor off of their target.

Players should not be able to interact with their inventory faster than someone moving a mouse and clicking the left mouse button. This cripples the game balance and puts anyone with a worse internet connection, slower reaction speeds, or laggier computer at a distinct disadvantage against people who can macro their inventory management.

I can set up autohotkey so that I can withdraw a stun baton from my backpack, turn it on, and then click someone by just holding down a key and pressing M1 over someone. This shit needs to stop.

If a do_after() on hotkey management is too harsh, we can apply a combat click cooldown every time you use the hotkeys instead to discourage combat macro abuse.
Swapped it over to a click cooldown.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ‚âà 1 month.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

Edit: I accidentally amended this commit instead o creating a new one:

Changed "Trackpad Interactions" to "Trackpad Simulation"

Now we finally have a solution that sounds good, is concise, and reasonably clear about the things it does why people might want to toggle it. (Scroll bouncing annoys some people, especially with a free-spinning scrollwheel and horizontal scroll between pages also annoys some people)

Also refactored NSAttributedString manipulation, added lots of docs and probably more I forgot.

----

Original commit

Changed "Advanced Navigation" to "Trackpad Interactions".

Not happy with it. The problem I'm really trying to solve is that I want people to understand it turns off scroll-bouncing, since that is the main reason why people might want to turn it off.  But I also want to mention that it lets you scroll between pages in Safari since that's a cool feature.

But I don't really know how to explain

 the scroll bouncing in a hint text. And also mentioning the bouncing and the scroll between pages in the hint text together would take up too much space.

So I guess if we rename to "trackpad interactions", that doesn't sound as good, but at least it makes it somewhat plausible to expect that this option turns off the scroll-bouncing.

I think it doesn't sound as good as "Advanced Navigation" and I don't like mentioning the trackpad directly in feature names. Because you should be thinking about what to do with it and how it works in and of itself. The fact that it works similar to a trackpad is more of an implementation detail.

But in this case I really don't know how to communicate all the things that this feature does in a concise manner except for "makes things work like a trackpad".

There is also no space in the hint for saying "makes things work like a trackpad" since we're already mentioning the safari page navigation.

And I really like giving an example of one of the useful things it actually does, instead of "JUST" saying "it makes things work like a trackpad", because that's very abstract and might be unclear.

So calling it "Trackpad Interactions" and then mentioning the scroll between pages in the hint is the best solution I can come up with for now. Even though it's not perfect.

Edit: I just reallllyyy dislike the name "Trackpad Interactions" vs "Advanced Navigation". I don't understand why, though. May go back if I dislike it too much.

infra: convert UI libraries to maven

Convert also the external libraries used by the UI bundle to plain Maven
coordinates. Import the packages provided by the libraries with the
minimum package version matching the current library version.

The version number 1.0 for jfreechart-swt is not an error. The previous
jfreechart-1.0.19-swt was part of the jfreechart-1.0.19 (without SWT)
release. It has been split out into a separate project now with version
number 1.0 (so that new 1.0 is more recent than the old 1.0.19). That's
also where the change of the "experimental" package name comes from.

In a future change we should also upgrade the libraries, but I want to
do that separately, because I remember these libraries have trouble with
the module system and its restrictions.

And finally, the target platform has been split once more as suggested
in previous comments to have the root target file only include other
targets but not reference any library by itself.

Enable basic Kept validation in NativeAOT running linker tests (#78828)

This implements basic Type and Method Kept attribute validation.
It adds a `KeptBy` property on all `KeptAttribute` which uses the same `ProducedBy` enum to specify exceptions for each target product. (Eventually after the source merge we should rename `ProducedBy` enum to just `Tool` or `Platform`, but it's not important and I didn't want to do it here as it would be a giant diff).

The validation is done by going over all `ConstructedEETypeNode` and `IMethodBodyNode` nodes in the final graph and remembers that list. Then it compares that list to the expected kept members as per the attributes in tests. There are some tweaks:
* Filters out all compiler added types/members
* Doesn't track generic instantiations - only remember definition
* If a method body is kept, then it behaves as if the type is also kept even though there's no `ConstructedEETypeNode` - this is technically wrong (since NativeAOT can remove the type if for example only static methods are used from it), but it would require major changes to the linker tests (since in IL this is a necessity). If we ever need precise validation of this, we would probably add a new attribute to check just for this.

I also copied all of the "other assemblies" kept validation code from ResultChecker (were it lives in linker) to AssemblyChecker where it will need to be to actually work (and where it should probably be anyway). That code is not used yet.

Left lot of TODO/commented out code in the AssemblyChecker - lots of other validation to enable eventually.

Fixed/adapted all of the tests which were already ported to NativeAOT to pass with this new validation.
Removed a test for unresolved members, since it actually fails NativeAOT compilation, so it doesn't test anything really.

One tiny product change:
Display names now consistently include all parent types when writing out nested type names. ILLink already does this and NativeAOT was a bit inconsistent. Since the display names are used only in diagnostics, this brings the diagnostics experience closer between the two tools. The added benefit is that we can use display names to compare members between Cecil and Internal.TypeSystem more precisely.

Excercise Equipment is now craftable (#71190)

## About The Pull Request

Imagine if you will a humble chaplain who wants nothing more than for
all of the spiritual folk on the station to get as massive gains as they
can, after finding that they can not just make more exercise equipment
and that the station does not have any in public places, they go annoy
security enough to get into permabrig only to find out that they cant
even unwrench the equipment and move it to the church!!!

NOT ANYMORE!!!

crafting a punching bag and punching it

Now you can craft as much exercise equipment as you want! May everyone
on the station get as strong as possible and not just prisoners.

Also I changed the message that plays when you try to use exercise
equipment someone else is using into a balloon alert.

![dreamseeker_PwNesmcR1f](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116288367/200890964-4f9fa3ee-ce07-4e6e-815c-a3f4593d06b1.png)

## Why It's Good For The Game

Access to exercise equipment on some maps is limited to static positions
and is currently mostly only for prisoners as every map does not have
public exercise equipment. Expanding the access means that you can have
a Drill Sargent Head of Security or Captain who commands people use
these or allows a psychologist to prescribe healthy exercise habits to
their patients.

I think having the potential for exercise equipment on every map is more
fun and also if prisoners get their hands on tools they should be
allowed to mess with these to annoy security or aid in their escape.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: the punching bag, bench press, and chest press are all able to be
crafted and unanchored.
add: crafting recipes for the above
qol: changed a chat message into a balloon alert
qol: adds screentips to equipment (thanks for suggesting i do this

Adds a reagent injector component and BCI manipulators to all circuit labs (#71236)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

This PR adds a reagent injector component that's exclusive to BCIs.
(Requested to be integrated into BCIs by Mothblocks.)
When outside of a circuit, the component itself stores the reagents.
However, if it's inside of a BCI, the storage is moved to the BCI. The
storage can contain up to 15u of reagents and acts like an open
container. (However, it won't spill even if you throw it, it just acts
like an open container code-wise, don't worry about it.)
You can only have one reagent injector in a circuit. Trying to insert
multiple will give you an error message.
The entire dose is administered at once. (Requirement set by
Mothblocks.)

Please don't try to dispute any of the specific limitations in the
comments as they're out of my control. They're reasonable anyways.

Reagent Injector Input/Output:
Inject (Input Signal) - Administers all reagents currently stored inside
of the BCI into the user.
Injected (Output Signal) - Triggered when reagents are injected. Not
triggered if the reagent storage is empty.

New BCI Input:
Show Charge Meter (Number) - Toggles showing the charge meter action.
(Adds some capacity for stealth.)

Install Detector Outputs: (Added following a comment about having to use
weird workarounds for proper loops.)
Current State (Number) - Outputs 1 if the BCI is implanted and 0 if it's
not.
Installed (Signal) - Triggered when the BCI is implanted into it's user.
Removed (Signal) - Triggered when the BCI is removed from it's user.

This PR also adds BCI manipulation chambers to all currently present
circuit labs. (Solution proposed by Mothblocks.)
Yes I had to do some other mapping changes to allow for this. No I don't
have any mapping experience, why do you ask?

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game

One small step for BCIs, one giant leap for circuit kind. (First
"proper" circuit to human interaction in the entire game!)

This allows for some funky stuff and also makes it less of a pain in the
ass to use BCIs. What's not to love?

<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,
especially if they are controversial and/or far reaching. If you can't
actually explain WHY what you are doing will improve the game, then it
probably isn't good for the game in the first place. -->

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. You can read up on GBP
and it's effects on PRs in the tgstation guides for contributors. Please
note that maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags

Trophy case update (#71015)

## About The Pull Request

I have been chipping away/procrastinating at this since May, but after
several years, I have finally updated how Trophy Cases work.

So, what this PR does is the following:

- Standardized everything in persistence.dm to use snake case, and added
basic autodocs
- Automatically moves trophies from data/npc_saves/TrophyItems.json to
data/trophy_items.json. Removed legacy .sav conversion by request, it
has been a long time.
- Trophy cases are opened and loaded the same way you would open a
regular ID locked display case (used curator access, relevant access
autodoc has been updated)
- Instead of cheap plastic replicas that turn to dust anyways, trophy
cases use holograms, which can be dispelled by hand
- Trophy data gets saved if an item stays in the trophy case when the
shuttle arrives to centcom, and the item has a description set. This is
in line with paintings, which has to still hang on the wall at round
end.
- You can edit the description of new trophies by using the librarian's
key to unlock History Mode
- When you click on a closed trophy case, it will open a tgui, and will
not display the case description. It will still do for open cases.
Vendatrays have been updated to do the same.
- The UI's icon uses icon2base64(getFlatIcon(showpiece, no_anim=TRUE)).
Vendatrays have been updated similarly, so items with directions and
animations are displayed properly. The base64 strings are updated in
update_static_data.
- Fixes vendatrays from displaying some characters in strange ways, such
as displaying /improper.
- Renames some one letter, or nonindicate argument and var names in
trophy case code
- Adds a trophy management admin panel, where admins can finally delete
all the curator ID cards swallowed over the years. Or, they can replace
the paths with funny new paths.
- If an entry has an incorrect, no longer existing path, it will be
marked red in the management panel
- Adds MAX_PLAQUE_LEN define, which 144 characters
- Removes start_showpieces from trophy cases, as it was completely
unused. The start_showpiece_type var is still around.
- Moves trophy_message var to trophy cases. Only a dice collector
display case used them in the Snowdin map.

What this PR does not do

- Sadly, it still only saves the base image of an item, and no layers or
altered image states. This has to come in the future.

Removes Bowls from garbage spawners because they don't fit in trash bags and I'm SICK of not being able to clean! (#71152)

## About The Pull Request
Let me give you a scenario.

---

THIS, is you. Say hi!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76465278/200268480-9dcf1f45-3bc5-402d-b743-b0649deefb08.png)

You're a loyal janitor aboard NT-SS13. You love your job; despite the
dangers, it's generally not too busy or tedious. Just a spray, a sweep,
and put it all in a bag.

---

This. This is your enemy.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76465278/200269058-957ca433-4666-44b5-9c10-ae0da75219cb.png)

Some crewmembers continuously leave them in maintenance, tossing them
into garbage bins as they pass.
This bowl, you cannot spray it. You can sweep it as far as you want, but
in the end, cannot put it into the bag.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76465278/200269156-bbc7758b-9cbe-4a3b-8d17-9aa53254b4b2.png)

---

It exists to torment you.
Nothing more, nothing less.

You hate the bowl. And it hates you.
Wake up.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Usually when you pass a trash pile you expect it to have trash, and
entire bowls aren't technically trash code-wise, nor can you clean them.
Yes, this PR has a modicum of salt. It was salt left behind in THE DAMN
BOWLS.
## Changelog
:cl:
del: NT has decided to begin a Recycling initiative, asking crew to
please stop throwing their bowls away in maintenance. You should only
find trash and grime from now on!

Fixes mineral turfs having weird lighting (#71219)

## About The Pull Request

Pixel offsets, unlike transforms, offset overlays too. this was breaking
lighting overlays for mineral walls.

We did pixel offsets to save on init time, but we can acomplish the same
thing using an initial matrix. It's static, so there's no additional
cost. S free

Damn moth

[MIRROR] Biogen Refactor and Code Cleanup, Faster Biomass Conversion and No More Biomass Cap! [MDB IGNORE] (#17828)

* Biogen Refactor and Code Cleanup, Faster Biomass Conversion and No More Biomass Cap! (#71563)

## About The Pull Request
So, I looked at the Biogenerator code and there was just, _so_ much old
and undocumented code, that I just spazzed out and started documenting
and refactoring everything. There's now a lot less usage of contents
lookups and for loops, and _almost_ everything is documented, now, too.

As for the changes, as you can see in the title, I made biomass
conversion faster. How much faster, you ask? 5 times faster with default
parts, up to 20 times faster with the best parts. It was painfully slow,
and that's not fun for anyone.

I also lifted the biomass cap. It wasn't useful, it wasn't fun, and
Melbert didn't really agree with it either. However, I enjoyed the look
of the biomass going up, so I gave it a max visual amount of 5000, so
you get to see it gradually filling up as you put your first 5000
biomass in. After that, you do you, chief. Watch the funny numbers go up
all you want.

I also improved the maths so that it wasn't just rounding stuff
constantly, and also gave a little bit more insight on how much biomass
everything would cost you, down to two decimals. If there's no decimals,
it won't show them, however.

<details>
<summary>Here's what that looks like now:</summary>
That's one screenshot per different decimal places, there's no trailing
zeros because I think we can all universally agree that those look bad
in this kind of setting.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58045821/204120744-a8c398dc-7c19-4ee0-a8cb-5615f1dce1ea.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58045821/204120749-90aae203-bdb8-4322-a657-bb4fd313d808.png)

</details>

There's now also more information displayed when you examine the biogen,
namely, how many items it has stored, and how many it can hold. I also
fixed the formatting a bit, so it looks ever so slightly cleaner.

Other than that, I just improved the code everywhere I saw it to be
fitting, there shouldn't be any single-letter variables in there
anymore, and the code should be more spaced out. Honestly, at this
point, I wrote most of this code six hours ago so I don't remember all
of it, and I'm too lazy to go through and check what I've changed again.
Diff and changelog are there for that.

## Why It's Good For The Game
So, I'll be honest, there were two big reasons that motivated me to do
this. First of all, the biomass cap. That was a little silly, anyone
that has spent more than one shift in Hydroponics knows that you usually
only put Watermelons in the biomass generator as they're usually the
thing that nets you the most biomass. Botanists will generally stock the
fridges first, and if they have a lot of excess, they'll put it in the
generator if they want, but that's rarely what was done. I've talked
with @ MrMelbert about it and he gave me the go-ahead, as can be seen
here:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58045821/204115174-fb2610c0-61c5-44e1-845e-cc6925ee33e6.png)

The other reason was the excruciatingly slow processing speed, which
I've fixed. So we're good now. :)

## Changelog

:cl: GoldenAlpharex
refactor: Went through and refactored a lot of the old code of the
biogenerator, and made multiple improvements to its logic, which should
hopefully make it behave more consistently. Nearly all of it is now also
fully documented, so as to make it easier for anyone else that has to
sift through it in the future.
qol: The biogenerator now processes items five times faster, up to 20
times faster if properly upgraded!
qol: The biogenerator is no longer capped on biomass. Its visuals will
change up until 5000 biomass, but you're free to go as high as you'd
like with it! Sky's the limit!
fix: Fixed the logic of the biogenerator that would make it so the
amount of biomass used for recipes was wildly inconsistent. Now, there's
no more back-end rounding up, it's all on the front end when it needs to
be, so there's no loss or gain of biomass when there shouldn't be.
spellcheck: Fixed a capitalization issue with the seaweed sheets in the
biogenerator recipes.
spellcheck: Fixed multiple inconsistencies between the messages sent to
your chat by the biogenerator.

add cool banner for error pages (#36)

Hiiiii it's carp! I think this error means that there's a timeout error. And I think that means something took too long to load so it decided not to work at all. If you keep seeing this on the same page <I>but not other pages</I>, then something is probably wrong with that specific function. It may not be called a function, but that sounds right to me. Anyway, <s>ping me and I'll whine to someone smarter to fix it. Don't bother them.</s> <B>After a year and a half of infuriating pings, the new instructions are to quit whining and just wait until it works again oh my god shut UP.</B><BR><BR> Thanks ily <3

Moves speaking verbs to tongues + subtypes, moves wing sprites to wing subtypes, bodypart damage examines to limbs, fixes sign language not working without a tongue (#71635)

## About The Pull Request

### Moves speaking verbs to tongues + subtypes
Moves species say mod onto tongues, creates any tongues that didn't
exist for the say mods they needed to hold.

### moves wing sprites to wing subtypes
Moves the logic of selecting a wing sprite onto subtypes of /functional
on the wing type. Now, angel wings bring the holy trait with them, it
isn't a special check on flight potions, and we can expand it. (EMPs
taking down robowings? Fires burning megamoth wings? Cool stuff)

### bodypart damage examines to limbs
Instead of checking what your species says, it tallies up your limbs and
provides the damage description that matches most of your limbs. So for
example, If you're mostly human with one augmented part, you take
bruises and cuts. If you're mostly robot augmented with one human part,
you get robot damage descriptions. Yay!

### fixes sign language working without a tongue
Having no tongue would garble your speech, and this had no interaction
with sign language, so you'd be speaking in broken gurgling with
perfectly working hands. Now, the sign language component prevents any
kind of garbling, since it brings its own garbling for full/missing arms


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40974010/204932511-42c8e020-a2d7-4fc1-befc-7cd46a2f2932.png)

## Why It's Good For The Game

Moving things off of species inherent makes the game expose way more
interesting mechanics to play with. It sucks that you can't steal a
jellyperson's chirping, since they can get a normal tongue and they'll
go back to... chirping! LAME! THAT IS LAME!

Ditto goes for wings, and for limbs, well, having someone be entirely
augmented but get descriptions of bleeding because they didn't spawn as
an android is kinda lame.
