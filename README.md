Drill module automatically disables if it's about to drill into gibtonite (#77385)

## About The Pull Request

Drill module automatically disables if it's about to drill into
gibtonite.

## Why It's Good For The Game

> Drill module automatically disables if it's about to drill into
gibtonite

There's not enough time to react, the mining scanner is surprisingly
slow sometimes and it means you drill straight into gibtonite, which
primes it the first drill and blows it up the second, which is a lot
more of a pain than it sounds because drilling is night-instant. These
explosions are usually enough to crit you, and if they don't, the stun
and area clear means any fauna can wander in and finish you off.

The auto-disable still makes it an annoyance to stumble upon gibtonite,
but it won't round end you for using modsuits.

## Changelog

Skrem's Quick Ballistic Glanceover (#2354)

## About The Pull Request

If maintainers want me to shorten the changelog, I can, I tend to start
there so I know what to talk about up here.

What started as a PR meant to buff up rubber rounds ended up turning
into a general passover I gave to much of the syntax and presentation of
ballistics. PR doesn't actually change that much function-wise, but it
changes a lot of lines due to a lot of changed pathing to better
establish consistency within ballistic code as well as overviewing a lot
of descriptions, names, and inherit moments.

Functionally, less-lethals and sniper rounds have been changed the most
by this PR. To a lesser extent, .38 special and shotgun rounds have been
tweaked. Finally, the PR stamps out a missing sprite bug with the WT-550
magazines, buffs up the surplus rifle (yeah, that old thing), tinkers
with some projectile speeds, makes match rounds slightly better, and
goes over A LOT of descriptions. I apologize for the massive wall of
text that's to follow.

Will take a look at energy weapons when I feel like it (might kill
disablers, I don't like mapping though).

## Why It's Good For The Game

### Slug and Pellet Changes
The pellet changes are actually just systemizing what was supposed to be
intentional design according to code comments, it just hadn't reached
every single pellet-based shotgun projectile. The improvised shell buff
is to make it not a potential complete whiff because RNG mechanics are
generally bad and not fun to play with.

### Less-Lethal Changes
Several implementations of less-lethal (rubber) ammunition on shiptest
are strictly worse than their standard alternatives. While this isn't a
PvP server, it feels very not-fun meta-wise to POTENTIALLY arm for SOME
insubordination and still fire what may as well be a round that bleeds
someone out (as they'll cause bleeding anyway). Increasing the stamina
damage on each of these makes it so they actually have a vague trade-off
(maybe stamina damage can do something like slow simplemobs in the
future, I don't know, I'd love to do it but simplemob code makes me
screech).

To make them not directly better in PvP and not the staple of taking
down the Super Scary Syndicate Shocktrooper Guy, they've had their
negative AP doubled. Not as good against combatants, but still perfectly
adept, if not better at general riot control against civilians. Makes
sense and puts them in their niche a little better.

### .38 Changes
The .38 special round relatively has more "power" and "velocity"
compared to the 9mm round, though it does not quite reach the levels
that .45 automatic or 10mm does in the IRL server. Furthermore, .38
special was specifically designed not to over-penetrate targets so as to
minimize the chance of collateral damage in police work. These are the
ultimate justifications behind giving it the worst AP out of all the
pistol calibers (-30, instead of -20) while still raising its damage to
25.

This should make the Winchester a better staple for taking out weaker
enemies such as legions or unarmored hermits, but it'll perform worse
against goliaths, frontiersmen, and the like. All-in-all, a more
"early-game" caliber, if you will, which is kinda what it's always been.

### Projectile Speed and Match Changes
Match rounds don't really exist as far as I've seen. That being said,
they're meant to be of higher quality, so their getting slightly higher
AP and speed makes sense, even if they're mostly just a meme round.

The speed increase of DMR/sniper rounds is primarily meant to
differentiate them better from AR rounds beyond having 20 more AP.
Assault rifles so far have pretty much dominated with better magazine
size, fire rate, and the exact same force as the DMR calibers, just
doing less damage against armored targets (doesn't matter too much when
you can just vomit rounds). I'd like to buff up the DMR damage even more
(sniper is fine), but I'd rather get some feedback on changing them to
35 baseline before doing so.

The speed decrease on shotguns is meant to cement them as CQC weapons.
Slugs are heavy. Shotguns are meant for close range. It's not much, but
it's thematically a good way to keep them in their lane, not that
they're even that problematic, hence only the slight change.

### Sniper Rifle Knockdown Change
Having a big-ass bullet that does 70 damage with 50 AP hit you is
already a middle finger. Making it potentially knock off an arm or a leg
is another middle finger. Being hardstunned for ten seconds after is the
icing on the cake. Changed it to a knockdown because we hate ranged
tasers.

### Surplus Rifle Fire Rate Buff
This thing is a joke. I haven't even seen it on the server, but I'd
rather make it vaguely competitive considering 10mm isn't super deadly
and only otherwise exists on the stechkin or the one Inteq SMG that you
never see (Colossus-only).

It's still clunky and terrible, but it should be less comedic and more
of a potential option if you have NOTHING else (will never happen).

### Boarder Magazine Change
Top-loading magazine fits into a standard assault rifle? No. Doesn't
make sense. Someone should probably just kill this gun, it's stupid and
looks stupid last I checked.

### WT-550 Magazine Fix
Don't think I've seen anyone use this weapon, I've only printed out
their magazines to dump AP rounds into my NT-SVG carbine. Noticed they
were invisible then. Someone increased their capacity to 30 without a
care for how its update_icon works. Not cool. Anyway, fixes are good.
Moving on.

### Syntax, Description, Spelling, and Overall Presentation Changes
Something very important when maintaining code is generally keeping
consistency in how things are not only presented, but how they're stored
as well. While I'd love to do EVEN more in the method of refactoring to
better align how so much of gun code works, this was something I wanted
to keep as a one-day project, so I mostly tinkered with pathing,
inherits, and groupings.

In the avenue of spelling and description changes, that's just 1)
Cleaning up errors that PR authors and maintainers missed and 2) Making
things more concise and just... better. Some of the SolGov descriptions
were a real headache to look at, and not because of the frequent
spelling and syntax errors.

Whoever misspelled and caused an entire series of items to be
/obj/item/gun/ballistic/automatic/assualt may wish to avoid any crows
for the next three months.

Perfectly willing to adjust or reel back some of my descriptions if
someone can offer something better than what I've written out if there's
some soul they REALLY want to keep.

## Changelog

:cl:
tweak: The NT 'Boarder' ARG now loads standard P-16 magazines, rather
than the M-90gl toploaders.
balance: .38 special does 25 damage up from 20. AP has been reduced to
-30 from -20.
balance: Standardizes pellet projectiles to lose 10% damage of both
types per tile across the board. Improvised pellets no longer have a
hardcapped 1-8 tile range.
balance: Less-lethal rounds now do 50% more stamina than the force of
their lethal counterparts, with 25% the normal force and double the
negative AP. If the round had positive or zero AP, it was subtracted by
20.
balance: Shotgun slugs do 40 damage, down from 60, but have zero AP,
rather than -10. FRAG-12 and meteor slugs have had their damage adjusted
to reflect their relative force.
balance: Surplus rifle fire_delay has been cut to 1 second from 3.
balance: .50 BMG knocks down instead of hardstunning.
balance: Any DMR, match, or sniper round now travels slightly faster
than other bullets. Shotgun slugs and pellets now travel slightly slower
than other bullets.
balance: Match rounds have had their AP slightly increased.
fix: Fixed WT-550 magazines not displaying properly.
spellcheck: Went over (almost) every single ballistic description,
including the guns themselves, magazines, ballistic casings, and speed
loaders/stripper clips to not only have better consistency and
readability, but also be more clear on the general effectiveness of each
caliber.
spellcheck: Assualt is gone.
code: Repaths/renames most ballistic ammo pathing to maintain
consistency or take advantage of inherits, when possible.

Martian Food: A Taste of the Red Planet (#75988)

## About The Pull Request
Adds a selection of new foods and drinks based around Mars.
More information on Mars can be found here:
https://github.com/tgstation/common_core/blob/master/Interesting%20Planets/Human%20Space/The%20Sol%20System.md
To summarise for the general audience, Mars is a vital colony of the
Terran Federation, having been primarily settled (at least originally)
by Cybersun Industries to harvest its lucrative supplies of plasma, the
second largest in human space behind Lavaland. This has given Mars a
diverse culture evolving from the mostly East Asian colonists, and their
food reflects this.

Thanks to Melbert for their work on the soup portion of this PR.

The food:
Martian cuisine draws upon the culinary traditions of East Asia, and
adds in fusion cuisine from the later colonists. Expect classics such as
ramen, curry, noodles and donburi, as well as new takes on the formula
like the Croque-Martienne, Peanut Butter Ice Cream Mochi, and the
Kitzushi- chilli cheese and rice inside a fried tofu casing. Oh, and
lots of pineapple. The Martians love pineapple:

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/58124831/c9ae33a1-e03a-4f94-8ce0-8ad124e88e8d)
Also included are some foods for Ethereals, which may or may not be
hinting at something I've got planned...

The drinks:
Four new base drinks make their way to the game, bringing with them a
host of new cocktails: enjoy new ventures in bartending with Coconut
Rum, Shochu/Soju, Yuyake (our favourite legally-distinct melon liqueur),
and Mars' favourite alcoholic beverage, rice beer. Each is available in
the dispenser, as well as bottles in the booze-o-mat:

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/58124831/914a6e2a-7ef5-4791-ae31-d08fa9211083)

The recipes:
To make your (and the wiki editors) lives easier, please find below the
recipes for both foods and drinks:
Food: https://hackmd.io/@EOBGames/BkVFU0w9Y
Drinks: https://hackmd.io/@EOBGames/rJ1OhnsJ2
## Why It's Good For The Game
Another lot of variety for the chef and bartender, as well as continuing
the work started with lizard and moth food in getting Common Core into
the game in a tangible and fun way.
## Changelog
:cl: EOBGames, MrMelbert
add: Mars celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Martian Concession
this year, and this has brought Martian cuisine to new heights of
popularity. Find a new selection of Martian foods and drinks available
in your crafting menu today!

feat(D1): DMAC Driver 2: Electric Boogaloo

This branch kinda rewrites a bunch of the DMAC code. Now, DMA channels
are capable of being dynamically allocated on demand using a cool atomic
bitset thingy, and released back to the DMAC pool when they're no longer
in use. This will allow us to have multiple drivers that consume
basically as many DMA channels as they want to, rather than having a
fixed assignment of DMA channels to drivers which has to be maintained
by manually updating the DMAC IRQ handler every time we add a new driver
that wants to do a DMA. A channel can be allocated from the pool once
and used for multiple transfers, if a driver needs to make a bunch of
transfers in sequence and doesn't want to have to round trip through the
channel pool, but they can also be grabbed for oneshot transfers and
immediately released.

I also fixed the cancel safety of the async `Channel::transfer`
(formerly `Channel::run_descriptor`) method, which would previously
leave the transfer running if the future is dropped. This means that if
a caller assumed dropping the transfer future meant that the transfer
descriptor's buffer could be freed, the transfer might complete later
and trample memory that has been reallocated. THAT SEEMS KINDA BAD LOL.
So, now, dropping a `Channel::transfer` future will cancel the transfer
if it hasn't finished yet, allowing fun stuff like attaching a timeout
to a transfer if you really want to. Of course, the transfer may still
have completed partially, and if we were writing to a device, the device
may be unhappy to have only gotten some of the data it wanted. But, at
least we don't have abandoned DMA transfers running around in random
parts of the heap you probably wanted to use for normal stuff like
having strings, or whatever it is that people do on the computer. So
that's better.

Unfortunately, while we can easily make the DMA transfers `Drop`-safe,
we can't really make them `mem::forget`-safe without passing the DMA
buffer into the future and leaking it if it gets forgetted. This is
probably a good idea but would require a nice higher-level interface
around constructing DMA descriptors from buffer-shaped memory regions,
which I didn't want to do tonight. So, the DMA transfer APIs are still
`unsafe` and maybe we can add a nicer thing on top later. In the
meantime, probably don't `mem::forget` DMA transfers. Honestly there is
no reason for normal people to do that so I don't feel super bad about
it.

Dazzling Update

Mobs

Half-Life
Not of the Black Mesa variety, this mostly-dead human wanders around like any normal player until they spot you... at which point, you better be prepared to fight like you mean it, because unlike a regular Zombie, they remember how to move their legs with haste, in addition to being able to swim! They bare a striking resemblence to somebody's brother... Hmm.

Wolfsbane
Freeing a Wolfsbane from it's curse (Attacking it under daylight) will now grant you ownership of the freed wolf immediately, in addition to making the wolf as strong as the Wolfsbane it was born from.


Armor

Cockatrice Head
Slows down close-by enemies who're looked at whilst worn! Sometimes drops from a slain Cockatrice.

Vampiric Helm
A new Mining Master-exclusive cross-compat item crafted with Spirit Garnets and a Headbiter! A direct upgrade to the base Headbiter helm.

Emerald Armour
While only slightly stronger than Diamond gear, Emerald Armour places an emphasis on weight, granting fantastic knockback resistance. Only found as rare loot from Zombies normally, it can also be created in the Gem Forge if both Mining Master and Spelunkery are installed.

Amethyst Armor
An upgrade to Gold Armor, this beautiful crystaline set is marginally stronger than iron in resistance. It also looks very pretty...! Can be dropped from armour-wearing mobs or forged in a Mining Master Gem Forge.


- Fixed Vigor Wearer config option having a commentless comment
- Cockatrices no longer affected by/contribute to the precision strike mechanic/advancement
- Removed Bull, Boar, Ram and Rooster replacement config options
- Bull, Boar, Ram and Roosters are now classified 'monsters', will only spawn at night, and will naturally despawn. 
- Petrimen, Vampires, Creeps and Trolls now no longer despawn Zombies, Skeletons, Creepers and Endermen, but instead spawn alongside them if their given Replacement rule is enabled. Done to try and circumvent the crashes that would sometimes seemingly occur due to the replacement procedure.

- Added new conditions for the animal mob spawns in addition to Dragonflies, Frigids, Scorpions, and Goblins who were spawning outside of their intended biomes. Their spawn biomes are now controlled by the is_(mob) entity_type tags under the forge directory in the EE data path, so edit those for ease of use. 

- Vigors-wearers now have a 5 second grace period where they can't continue applying the vigor effect to their allies
- Intruders now take self-damage from exploding.
- Bottled Flutterflies can now be released if placed on the ground.
- Headbiter now requires inflicting critical damage to gain health back for living entities
- Headbiter's Regeneration now only heals half a heart per hit, but heals a whole heart upon securing a kill, in addition to a stronger speed buff
- Reduced number of particles incurred by damaging a Vigor
- Cinder Crown can now be Forged in a Gem Forge from Mining Master
- Removed Burning Speed Up misc config option

- Cleaned up advancement tree
- Added Trolled advancement
- Added Stop Right There, Criminal Scum! advancement
- Added Mercy advancement
- Added You're All Free!
- Added Friendship Heals All Wounds advancement
- Added King Hot-Head advancement
- Deflecting a Caster's projectile now grants the Not Today, Thank You advancement

Adds Blood-drunk and demonic frost miner boss music. (#78123)

Acts as a continuation of PR #77149 for boss music functionality and
implements a BDM and demonic frost miner boss music theme.

More music is good, but I do have some gripes with my own PR. This
particular track relies on instrumentation that when compressed just
doesn't sound as good, and the in-game version is noticeably less
enjoyable that the high quality version. I wish I could help the track
out more, but as is it's already at 811 kb which is barely in line with
file requirements, so i just can't justify bloating the audio file sizes
to make it sound better. You notice this kind of problem a lot with the
higher runtime music and background tracks. It just feels a bit more
clunky than hierophant, but what are you gonna do right?

## About The Pull Request

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game
Whitelist are run by name, so renaming a whitelisted species also needs
an update to the WL as well.
Removes a shitty gimmick of a mirror most people dont have access to
because its a fucking nightmare of conditions we partially removed
and a fix for both runtimes and uninteded stat cheating
<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,
especially if they are controversial and/or far reaching. If you can't
actually explain WHY what you are doing will improve the game, then it
probably isn't good for the game in the first place. -->

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. You can read up on GBP
and it's effects on PRs in the tgstation guides for contributors. Please
note that maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags
should they deem it appropriate. You can attempt to finagle the system
all you want, but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off
the bat. -->

:cl:
del: Removed the code behind the raider mirror
fix: fixed the shadekin traits applying to non shadekin

Funny clown internals (#77963)

# About The Pull Request
This PR changes the internals that spawn inside the clown's survival box
for a new one with a rainbow sprite, higher O2 volume (same as the engi
ones) and a secondary gas on top of O2 to make things more interesting
for the clowns.
The gas options are:
BZ, which just adds hallucinations for the clown, without the brain
damage effect as it is in low percentages.
N2O will make the clown giggle and laugh, without the sleep.
Helium will give the clown a "funny voice".

These tanks are also added to the mail list of clown fans and the clown
costume crate at cargo.

And codersprites, I can polish them later if people think it is pixel
soup, I'm not happy with them that much, but making this looks good
might be above my paygrade...

</p>
</details>

## Why It's Good For The Game
The main goal I have with this is to add more uses for Atmos Content to
other players in a flavorful way.
Atmos is not something the crew interacts in a positive way often and I
want to change that.

These tanks are something quite minor but flavorful IMO, also will make
people know Helium fucking exists...

The tanks *shouldn't* change much of the clown's round in a negative
way, and the default O2 internals are in every hallway's locker so even
if they don't want to deal with the hallucinations it is not a big deal
to dodge them.
## Changelog
:cl: Guillaume Prata
add: New funny internals for the clowns to spawn with. They come with O2
and a secondary gas between 3 options: BZ, Helium and N2O. Talk with a
"different tone" with Helium, giggle and laugh "uncontrollably" while
under the minor effects of N2O or have "fun" hallucinations while under
the minor effects of BZ.
balance: To not cut on how long the clown's O2 internals last due to the
mixed gases, the funny internals have 50% more gas volume, same as
engineers' internals.

Conveyor Belts are now easier to extend and have screentips (#78278)

## About The Pull Request

Conveyor belt **stacks** now have a better examine text.

Using a conveyor belt stack on a placed conveyor belt now extends the
conveyor belt by 1 tile, linking to it's ID automatically, and makes for
much easier building of conveyor belt setups.

Conveyor belts now come jam packed with screentips.

I've also added the default tile place sound to the usage of conveyor
stacks to provide a tiny bit of audio feedback when placing new conveyor
belts.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Conveyor belts are just mind-numbingly annoying to use in a regular
round, and trying to set up a new conveyor belt setup is confusing if
you don't have ultra specific information about how to make one before
you even start. Hell, I remember I had to add the *real* construction
steps to the wiki like 6 years ago and I STILL hear people getting
confused about how these works.

This improves their ease of use, while also making everyone sleep a
little easier for those of us who use them.

## Changelog

:cl:
qol: Conveyor belts now have screentips and a better examine tip to
teach you how to set one up properly.
qol: Using a conveyor belt stack on a placed conveyor belt will extend
the conveyor belt to the output of that conveyor belt.. You can use this
to place fully integrated conveyor belts much easier now.

Introducing KLapse - A kernel level livedisplay module v4.0:

Author: @tanish2k09 (email: tanish2k09.dev@gmail.com)

What is it?
Kernel-based Lapse ("K-Lapse") is a linear RGB scaling module that 'shifts' RGB based on time (of the day/selected by user), or (since v2.0) brightness. This concept is inspired from
LineageOS (formerly known as 'CyanogenMod') ROM's feature "livedisplay" which also changes the display settings (RGB, hue, temperature, etc) based on time.

Why did you decide to make this? (Tell me a story).
I (personally) am a big fan of the livedisplay feature found on LineageOS ROM. I used it every single day, since Android Lollipop. Starting from Android Nougat, a native night mode
solution was added to AOSP and it felt like livedisplay was still way superior, thanks to its various options (you could say it spoiled me, sure). I also maintained a kernel (Venom
kernel) for the device I was using at that time. It was all good until the OEM dropped support for the device at Android M, and XDA being XDA, was already working on N ROMs. The issue
was, these ROMs weren't LineageOS or based on it, so livedisplay was... gone. I decided I'll try to bring that feature to every other ROM. How would I do that? Of course! The kernel! It
worked on every single ROM, it was the key! I started to work on it ASAP and here it is, up on GitHub, licensed under GPL (check klapse.c), open to everyone :)

How does it work?
Think of it like a fancy night mode, but not really. Klapse is dependent on an RGB interface (like Gamma on MTK and KCAL on SD chipsets). It fetches time from the kernel, converts it to
local time, and selects and RGB set based on the time. The result is really smooth shifting of RGB over time.

How does it really work (dev)?
Klapse mode 1 (time-based scaling) uses a method void klapse_pulse(void) that should ideally be called every minute. This can be done by injecting a pulse call inside another method that
is called repeatedly naturally, like cpufreq or atomic or frame commits. It can be anything, whatever you like, even a kthread, as long as it is called repeatedly naturally. To execute
every 60 seconds, use jiffies or ktime, or any similar method. The pulse function fetches the current time and makes calculations based on the current hour and the values of the tunables
listed down below.

Klapse mode 2 (brightness-based scaling) uses a method void set_rgb_slider(<type> bl_lvl) where is the data type of the brightness level used in your kernel source. (OnePlus 6 uses u32
data type for bl_lvl) set_rgb_slider needs to be called/injected inside a function that sets brightness for your device. (OnePlus 6 uses dsi_panel.c for that, check out the diff for that
file in /op6)

What all stuff can it do?

1, Emulate night mode with the proper RGB settings
2, Smoothly scale from one set of RGB to another set of RGB in integral intervals over time.
3, Reduce perceived brightness using brightness_factor by reducing the amount of color on screen. Allows lower apparent brightness than system permits.
4, Scale RGB based on brightness of display (low brightness usually implies a dark environment, where yellowness is probably useful).
5, Automate the perceived brightness independent of whether klapse is enabled, using its own set of start and stop hours.
6, Be more efficient,faster by residing inside the kernel instead of having to use the HWC HAL like android's night mode.
7, (On older devices) Reduce stuttering or frame lags caused by native night mode.
8, An easier solution against overlay-based apps that run as service in userspace/Android and sometimes block apps asking for permissions.
9, Give you a Livedisplay alternative if it doesn't work in your ROM.
10, Impress your crush so you can get a date (Hey, don't forget to credit me if it works).

Alright, so this is a replacement for night mode?
NO! Not at all. One can say this is merely an alternative for LineageOS' Livedisplay, but inside a kernel. Night mode is a sub-function of both Livedisplay and KLapse. Most comparisons
here were made with night mode because that's what an average user uses, and will relate to the most. There is absolutely no reason for your Android kernel to not have KLapse. Go ahead
and add it or ask your kernel maintainer to. It's super-easy!

What can it NOT do (yet)?

1, Calculate scaling to the level of minutes, like "Start from 5:37pm till 7:19am". --TODO
2, Make coffee for you.
3, Fly you to the moon. Without a heavy suit.
4, Get you a monthly subscription of free food, cereal included.

All these following tunables are found in their respective files in /sys/klapse/

1. enable_klapse : A switch to enable or disable klapse. Values : 0 = off, 1 = on (since v2.0, 2 = brightness-dependent mode)
2. klapse_start_hour : The hour at which klapse should start scaling the RGB values from daytime to target (see next points). Values : 0-23
3. klapse_stop_hour : The hour by which klapse should scale back the RGB values from target to daytime (see next points). Values : 0-23
4. daytime_rgb : The RGB set that must be used for all the time outside of start and stop hour range.
5. target_rgb : The RGB set that must be scaled towards for all the time inside of start and stop hour range.
6. klapse_scaling_rate : Controls how soon the RGB reaches from daytime to target inside of start and stop hour range. Once target is reached, it remains constant till 30 minutes before
   stop hour, where target RGB scales back to daytime RGB.
7. brightness_factor : From the name itself, this value has the ability to bend perception and make your display appear as if it is at a lesser brightness level than it actually is at.
   It works by reducing the RGB values by the same factor. Values : 2-10, (10 means accurate brightness, 5 means 50% of current brightness, you get it)
8. brightness_factor_auto : A switch that allows you to automatically set the brightness factor in a set time range. Value : 0 = off, 1 = on
9. brightness_factor_auto_start_hour : The hour at which brightness_factor should be applied. Works only if #8 is 1. Values : 0-23
10. brightness_factor_auto_stop_hour : The hour at which brightness_factor should be reverted to 10. Works only if #8 is 1. Values : 0-23
11. backlight_range : The brightness range within which klapse should scale from daytime to target_rgb. Works only if #1 is 2. Values : MIN_BRIGHTNESS-MAX_BRIGHTNESS

Desouls Hivelord (#78213)

## About The Pull Request

Replaces the sprite of the hivelord with a new one, in my continuing
quest to annihilate the old asteroid mob sprites.
A (never completed) asteroid mob resprite was actually my first PR, this
one is my 200th.
I am also planning on fucking with basic mob versions of these mobs some
time but the sprites can be atomised out.

In addition to replacing the old-ass MSPaint sprites, this PR also adds
a short death animation effect to the hivelord brood (from hivelords or
legions) which looks nicer than them just vanishing instantly upon
death.

Look at this video for an example of the animation:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKaskN5-y2A

## Why It's Good For The Game

Looks nicer.

[TEST-MERGE FIRST] Wound refactor number two: Full synthetic support (#78124)

## About The Pull Request

Heavily refactors wounds AGAIN.

The primary thing this PR does is completely change how wounds are
generated and added - while the normal "hit a guy til they bleed" stuff
works about the same, asking for a specific type of wound, say, like how
vending machines try to apply a compound fracture sometimes, isnt going
to work if we ever get any non-organic wounds, which the previous
refactor allowed.

With this PR, however...
* You can now ask for a specific type of wound via
get_corresponding_wound_type(), which takes wound types, a limb, wound
series, etc. and will try to give you a wound fitting those
specifications - but also, a wound that can be applied to a limb.
* This will allow for a vending machine to apply a compound fracture to
a human, but a collapsed superstructure (assuming my synth wounds go in)
to a robot

There are now new "series types" and "wound specific types" that allow
us to designate what series are "mainline" and randomly generatable, and
what are "alternate types" and must be generated manually - you can see
the documentation in wounds.dm.

The behavior of limping and interaction delays has been abstracted to
datum/wound from bone wounds to allow just, general ease of development

Pregen data now allows for series-specific wound penalties. Example: You
could set a burn wound's series wound penalty to 40, which would make
wound progression in the burn category easier - but it would not make it
any easier to get a slashing wound. As it stands wound penalties are for
wounds globally

Scar files are now picked in a "priority" list, where the wound checks
to see if the limb has a biostate before moving down in said list.
Example: Wounds will check for flesh first, if it finds it - it will use
the flesh scar list. Failing that, they then check bone - if it uses
that, it will use the bone scar list. This allows for significantly more
modular scars that dont even need much proc editing when a new wound
type is added

Misc changes: most initial() usage has been replaced by singleton
datums, wound_type is now wound_types and thus wounds can accept
multiple wound types, wounds can now accept multiple tool behaviors for
treatment, wounds now have a picking weight so we can make certain
wounds rarer flatly,

This PR also allows for wounds to override lower severity wounds on
generation, allowing eswords to jump to avulsions - but in spirit of
refactoring, this has been disabled by default (see pregen data's
competition_mode var).
## Why It's Good For The Game

Code quality is good!

Also, all the changes above allow wounds to be a MUCH more modular
system, which is one of its biggest problems right now - everything is
kinda hardcoded and static, making creative work within wounds harder to
do.

## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: Refactored wounds yet again
fix: Wounds are now picked from the most severe down again, meaning
eswords can jump to avulsions
fix: Scar descs are now properly applied

FROMGIT: bpf: Do not change gso_size during bpf_skb_change_proto()

This is technically a backwards incompatible change in behaviour, but I'm
going to argue that it is very unlikely to break things, and likely to fix
*far* more then it breaks.

In no particular order, various reasons follow:

(a) I've long had a bug assigned to myself to debug a super rare kernel crash
on Android Pixel phones which can (per stacktrace) be traced back to BPF clat
IPv6 to IPv4 protocol conversion causing some sort of ugly failure much later
on during transmit deep in the GSO engine, AFAICT precisely because of this
change to gso_size, though I've never been able to manually reproduce it. I
believe it may be related to the particular network offload support of attached
USB ethernet dongle being used for tethering off of an IPv6-only cellular
connection. The reason might be we end up with more segments than max permitted,
or with a GSO packet with only one segment... (either way we break some
assumption and hit a BUG_ON)

(b) There is no check that the gso_size is > 20 when reducing it by 20, so we
might end up with a negative (or underflowing) gso_size or a gso_size of 0.
This can't possibly be good. Indeed this is probably somehow exploitable (or
at least can result in a kernel crash) by delivering crafted packets and perhaps
triggering an infinite loop or a divide by zero... As a reminder: gso_size (MSS)
is related to MTU, but not directly derived from it: gso_size/MSS may be
significantly smaller then one would get by deriving from local MTU. And on
some NICs (which do loose MTU checking on receive, it may even potentially be
larger, for example my work pc with 1500 MTU can receive 1520 byte frames [and
sometimes does due to bugs in a vendor plat46 implementation]). Indeed even just
going from 21 to 1 is potentially problematic because it increases the number
of segments by a factor of 21 (think DoS, or some other crash due to too many
segments).

(c) It's always safe to not increase the gso_size, because it doesn't result in
the max packet size increasing.  So the skb_increase_gso_size() call was always
unnecessary for correctness (and outright undesirable, see later). As such the
only part which is potentially dangerous (ie. could cause backwards compatibility
issues) is the removal of the skb_decrease_gso_size() call.

(d) If the packets are ultimately destined to the local device, then there is
absolutely no benefit to playing around with gso_size. It only matters if the
packets will egress the device. ie. we're either forwarding, or transmitting
from the device.

(e) This logic only triggers for packets which are GSO. It does not trigger for
skbs which are not GSO. It will not convert a non-GSO MTU sized packet into a
GSO packet (and you don't even know what the MTU is, so you can't even fix it).
As such your transmit path must *already* be able to handle an MTU 20 bytes
larger then your receive path (for IPv4 to IPv6 translation) - and indeed 28
bytes larger due to IPv4 fragments. Thus removing the skb_decrease_gso_size()
call doesn't actually increase the size of the packets your transmit side must
be able to handle. ie. to handle non-GSO max-MTU packets, the IPv4/IPv6 device/
route MTUs must already be set correctly. Since for example with an IPv4 egress
MTU of 1500, IPv4 to IPv6 translation will already build 1520 byte IPv6 frames,
so you need a 1520 byte device MTU. This means if your IPv6 device's egress
MTU is 1280, your IPv4 route must be 1260 (and actually 1252, because of the
need to handle fragments). This is to handle normal non-GSO packets. Thus the
reduction is simply not needed for GSO packets, because when they're correctly
built, they will already be the right size.

(f) TSO/GSO should be able to exactly undo GRO: the number of packets (TCP
segments) should not be modified, so that TCP's MSS counting works correctly
(this matters for congestion control). If protocol conversion changes the
gso_size, then the number of TCP segments may increase or decrease. Packet loss
after protocol conversion can result in partial loss of MSS segments that the
sender sent. How's the sending TCP stack going to react to receiving ACKs/SACKs
in the middle of the segments it sent?

(g) skb_{decrease,increase}_gso_size() are already no-ops for GSO_BY_FRAGS
case (besides triggering WARN_ON_ONCE). This means you already cannot guarantee
that gso_size (and thus resulting packet MTU) is changed. ie. you must assume
it won't be changed.

(h) changing gso_size is outright buggy for UDP GSO packets, where framing
matters (I believe that's also the case for SCTP, but it's already excluded
by [g]).  So the only remaining case is TCP, which also doesn't want it
(see [f]).

(i) see also the reasoning on the previous attempt at fixing this
(commit fa7b83bf3b156c767f3e4a25bbf3817b08f3ff8e) which shows that the current
behaviour causes TCP packet loss:

  In the forwarding path GRO -> BPF 6 to 4 -> GSO for TCP traffic, the
  coalesced packet payload can be > MSS, but < MSS + 20.

  bpf_skb_proto_6_to_4() will upgrade the MSS and it can be > the payload
  length. After then tcp_gso_segment checks for the payload length if it
  is <= MSS. The condition is causing the packet to be dropped.

  tcp_gso_segment():
    [...]
    mss = skb_shinfo(skb)->gso_size;
    if (unlikely(skb->len <= mss)) goto out;
    [...]

Thus changing the gso_size is simply a very bad idea. Increasing is unnecessary
and buggy, and decreasing can go negative.

garmin_parser: add support for developer fields

This was the _actual_ reason why the Suunto FIT file import fell flat on
its face: it adds records with developer fields in them, and I just had
no idea how to parse them.

It turns out that they aren't all *that* horrible to parse: they are
kind of like a special case of the regular FIT event fields.

And no, this does not really parse them: it only parses the layout, and
using that it can then skip the developer fields without causing the
decoder to go all wonky and lose stream synchronization.

At least it works for the specific case of the Suunto FIT files, and the
code makes some amount of sense.  The FIT format may be odd, but at the
same time it's most definitely designed for pretty simplistic devices,
so it's not some kind of crazy XML thing.

This gets us parsing those Suunto FIT files at least partially.

That said, it is all very rough indeed, since you have to lie and claim
you're downloading from a Garmin, and have to set up the whole magic
'Garmin/Activity/' directory structure and limit the file size to the 24
characters that Garmin uses.

So this is by no means the real solution.

Considering that Jef doesn't want the Garmin parser in libdivecomputer
anyway, the proper solution might be to move this all to subsurface, and
make it be a "FIT file import" thing instead.  Annoying, but on the
other hand it has also been a bit awkward to have it in libdivecomputer.

BACKPORT: migrate_pages: avoid blocking for IO in MIGRATE_SYNC_LIGHT

The MIGRATE_SYNC_LIGHT mode is intended to block for things that will
finish quickly but not for things that will take a long time.  Exactly how
long is too long is not well defined, but waits of tens of milliseconds is
likely non-ideal.

When putting a Chromebook under memory pressure (opening over 90 tabs on a
4GB machine) it was fairly easy to see delays waiting for some locks in
the kcompactd code path of > 100 ms.  While the laptop wasn't amazingly
usable in this state, it was still limping along and this state isn't
something artificial.  Sometimes we simply end up with a lot of memory
pressure.

Putting the same Chromebook under memory pressure while it was running
Android apps (though not stressing them) showed a much worse result (NOTE:
this was on a older kernel but the codepaths here are similar).  Android
apps on ChromeOS currently run from a 128K-block, zlib-compressed,
loopback-mounted squashfs disk.  If we get a page fault from something
backed by the squashfs filesystem we could end up holding a folio lock
while reading enough from disk to decompress 128K (and then decompressing
it using the somewhat slow zlib algorithms).  That reading goes through
the ext4 subsystem (because it's a loopback mount) before eventually
ending up in the block subsystem.  This extra jaunt adds extra overhead.
Without much work I could see cases where we ended up blocked on a folio
lock for over a second.  With more extreme memory pressure I could see up
to 25 seconds.

We considered adding a timeout in the case of MIGRATE_SYNC_LIGHT for the
two locks that were seen to be slow [1] and that generated much
discussion.  After discussion, it was decided that we should avoid waiting
for the two locks during MIGRATE_SYNC_LIGHT if they were being held for
IO.  We'll continue with the unbounded wait for the more full SYNC modes.

With this change, I couldn't see any slow waits on these locks with my
previous testcases.

NOTE: The reason I stated digging into this originally isn't because some
benchmark had gone awry, but because we've received in-the-field crash
reports where we have a hung task waiting on the page lock (which is the
equivalent code path on old kernels).  While the root cause of those
crashes is likely unrelated and won't be fixed by this patch, analyzing
those crash reports did point out these very long waits seemed like
something good to fix.  With this patch we should no longer hang waiting
on these locks, but presumably the system will still be in a bad shape and
hang somewhere else.

Restricts Scrapheap & Lepton Violet behind conditions, alters Rollerdome (#77277)

## About The Pull Request

Lepton Violet (wabbajack) shuttle must be unlocked by having some form
of polymorph happen in-game first (Pride Mirror or the cursed springs
are the most accessible sources)

Scrapheap shuttle can only be bought if the Cargo budget is below 600
credits, and the shuttle has just less than half of its usual refueling
time left. However, it gives the cargo budget an influx of 3000 credits!

Uncle Pete's Rollerdome has had its price increased, and the disco
machine is no longer unbreakable.

## Why It's Good For The Game

First off, here is my reasoning for why these need altering at all.

Players will always naturally gravitate to the wackiest and
most-out-there options, in this case this applies to shuttles. It's why
the Monastery or the Asteroid or Daniel are reasonably common sights,
more common than some of the 'boring' shuttle options that don't need
unlock with an emag.

The problem here, as I see it, is that there is no incentive
what-so-ever to NOT purchase these 'wacky' shuttles. Some of the
shuttles in the code are just way too stupid to be seen on most or even
some rounds (Arena, Disco Inferno?), so they require rare unlocks to
occur. Wacky shuttles being spammed round after round are bad due to
several reasons:
1. Players will run every joke to the ground. Wacky conditionless
shuttles take up a large amount of space in the shuttle memeplex, so
they are disproportionately seen in comparison to any of the
less-extravagant but more grounded and actually interesting options.
(Medisim? Monkeys anyone?). This ends up making the wacky shuttles
actually *less* wacky and just the stale and boring options.
2. Wacky shuttles affect the end-round quite a lot. This is fine, of
course, but not when these wacky shuttles can be seen every round.
3. These wacky shuttles don't have proper facilities. None of them have
a good medical section, or emergency supplies, or enough room. This gets
pretty annoying pretty fast.
4. One Funny Guy (the quintessential example being the clown with a dead
captain's ID) is all but guaranteed to try to buy the funniest and most
annoying shuttle to piss off the rest of the crew. With how Funny and
Annoying these shuttles are, not to mention how dirt-cheap they are (or
literally give you money!), they're easily the most seen alternate
shuttles, which isn't good when they alter how the round-end plays so
heavily.

> Lepton Violet (wabbajack) shuttle must be unlocked by having some form
of polymorph happen in-game first (Pride Mirror is the most accessible
source)

The Wabbajack has a endless source of voluntary Polymorphs with a
comically low price, which means it is purchased endlessly by crew, not
to mention being literally a source of free syndiborgs and xenos. While
I'm not a balanceposter, this does come with some annoyances especially
for antagonists who just randomly get blown up by an assault borg. This
is fine and fun every so often, but not as a common occurrence, not as a
guaranteed every-round option. I think it's an excellent candidate for
an unlock condition.

> Scrapheap shuttle can only be bought if the Cargo budget is below 600
credits, and the emergency shuttle is more than halfway refueled.
However, it gives the cargo budget an influx of 3000 credits!

This is LITERALLY 'haha grief shuttle', I have no idea how it even got
in as a condition-less shuttle. You see the captain buy it For No Raisin
Lul 2 minutes in, sigh to yourself, and secure an EVA suit when the
shuttle lands to try to survive in the unbelievably cramped space.
(Someone always blows it up.)

Instead of being JUST Grief Shuttle, now it has some interesting reasons
to exist. Revs and you're dirt-poor? Nukies just declared war after the
Clown bought ten crates of creampie dufflebags? Buy this shuttle and get
an influx of money.

> Uncle Pete's Rollerdome has had its price increased, and the disco
machine is no longer unbreakable.

This one isn't as egregious as the above, but I believe my personal
dislike of it extends to a game design level, to an extent. One person
can buy this shuttle and the crew as a whole are left to groan as they
prepare for a noisy, confusing shuttle in which everyone is ten tiles
shifted to their left as their sprite does the most ridiculous dance
seen in SS13 history. 'Just turn the music off!': I'm glad this is an
option, but it doesn't change how much this shuttle alters things. It's
fine as a sendoff to a nice, chill greenshift, but as a constant sight
in red shifts it's just... frustrating. And purchased BECAUSE it's
frustrating, to the short-lived schadenfreude of one person and the
frustration of others.

And then the unbreakable disco machine. Why is it unbreakable. If the
crew doesn't want to listen to the thing, let them break it? Buy Disco
Inferno if you want an unbreakable disco.

Some of these changes are probably over-the-top, but remember that these
will still be seen in-game, just a bit rarer. Worst case scenario the
shuttle replacement event will let them have their time in the
limelight.

levels: various QOL fixes.

Generally there should be nothing *necessary to finish a level* that requires any of:
- straferunning;
- extremely sensitive timing that could softlock you if you're on keyboard, lagging in multiplayer or have motor issues;
- checking only for a sound cue that something has happened;
- remembering how to distinguish two visually nearly identical areas; or
- backtracking to a previous area on the map that you had previously been given no reason to revisit.

I haven't caught all of them by any stretch of the imagination but it's a start.

Also some regular minor fixes.

E1M9
- Fixed some textures around the big blue-trimmed lift and removed an extraneous use line that triggered a faraway lift for no reason.
- The red key bridge lowerable section is now textured differently from the rest of the bridge.

E3M5
- Teleporter platform to get back up to the catwalk from the northeastern blood maze is now clearly marked as having a switch, as it is a mandatory progression rather than a secret.

E4M8
- Got rid of some fake contrasts on the noodles at the start.
- Added a radsuit for the northwest switch. While it is possible to avoid damage even without straferun, unless you've got a tic counter display and can time it to the damage interval this is basically RNG.
- The water flat on top of the lowering wall in the east was very, very noticeable. The switch is now stepped on instead of hit. (Not too sure if the secret isn't *too* obscure now...)
- Removed asymmetrical doortrak on the slime bridge on the southeastern piston switch.
- The linedefs of said slime bridge pit are flipped so a deathmatch opponent trying to grab the berserk in there is not magically immune to rocket blasts. (see #996)
- Realigned the four pistons by the gate to the starship. They also reveal moving parts when activated - not nearly as good as the crushers on the original DI, but better than nothing.
- Made the southern walls use PLAT1 to make it more obvious that those walls will lower later (with the added bonus that they match the four pistons).
- The southern light bronze area now has a strip to guide the player towards the switch in case they lose track of their direction while fighting monsters and forget to explore inside that area, as well as to better distinguish it from the southeast.
- The gate threshold to the southern light bronze area now matches that of the pre-opened southeast.
- There is now actually a threshold where you can tell where the starport ends and the ship begins.
- The two light bronze areas are a bit too similar-looking. Added a few health boosts so the player can spot/be attacked by them and know this is an unexplored area.

Map11
- The lift going down into the yellow key room requires a switch that is out of sight from the lift itself, which is not clearly marked as a lift to begin with. The only real way to realize what's going on if you don't already know about the lift is to locate the sound and immediately turn to investigate before the lift comes back up. I thought this was annoying when I first did my big overhaul of this map, but ultimately left the basic mechanism alone out of an abundance of caution; however, with the recent discussion of accessibility in the proposed changes to the documentation I'm revisiting this. That upper switch now lowers a wall to reveal the lift which is triggered by a walk line.
- The lower far switch on that same lift was actually literally *impossible* to make on keyboard and no straferun (and no vanilla wallbounce exploit), even if I change it to a regular lift instead of fast. This is completely unacceptable for something necessary to progression (rather than an obscure secret). The lower switches are now permanent repeatable floor-lowerers, while the line crossing from the lift into the lower chamber is a permanent repeatable floor-raiser, with the line crossing into the lift from above being a simple lift line.
- Retextured the stairs out of the water in the eastern branch so it's not an unreadable mess of criss-crossing grey lines.
- Realigned the new skull switch texture in the skull room.

Map19
- One of the stealth worms was stuck in a burning barrel.
- Removed monster block flag on line 2083.
- Unmerged and remerged a few identical sectors to better match the intended sound travel.
- Flagged line 281 as a monster blocker. This allows the player to always be able to make the jump onto that bottom stair without being blocked by the octaminator.
- That octaminator is now a pain bringer in easy mode. The far end of that platform path is well outside the maximum vertical autoaim range in vanilla, which means that to actually hit the octaminator without up/down aiming you'd have to be on one of the later platforms - i.e., confined to a relatively narrow area with no cover *against an opponent that has seeker missiles*. The best way to solve this is to charge towards the octaminator as fast and as soon as possible with the SSG, minigun, or ripsaw+prayer to RNGsus that you'll get a good painlock. This is not the kind of tactic the sort of person who *needs* to play on easy will think to do, or could do while also being ready to sidestep if the octaminator fires at the wrong time.
- 347 and 249 are now also monster blockers, and the worms in that slime pit have been moved to the platform just behind the combat slug since they're awakened early on and that's where you'll first encounter them anyway.
- Replaced the teleport pad in the vertical platforming sequence with a lift, to minimize disorientation and going the wrong way. (In retrospect I probably could have just made the teleport destination face the pit you came in from, but the lift worked aesthetically better anyway.)
- A good chunk of that entire platforming area has been moved 8 units to the west so that things would align with the flat grid.
- Lines 307 and 309 are now also monster blockers. The worm that would be trapped between them is now moved further down the route and marked ambush.

Map20
- Removed the useless, misleading skull switch texture on the bars at the start.
- The door leading into the blue key arena needs no blue key; the door leading out needs a blue key. Both are marked with blue-light trim. Removed the blue lights on the first one.
- The lowering wall leading to the teleporter now uses a pipe texture.
- The door leading out of the giant quadruped arena now has a bright flickering light.
- Yellow key is another case of effectively-randomly-mandatory damage. Added a path.
- Same with the lava tunnel on the red key route.

Map25
- The silver lift near the river and shack is now activated by SW1GSTON switch right on the wall at eye level, rather than counterintuitively and invisibly recessed into additional sectors.
- The painlord ambush lift is now accessible after the encounter. A small health refill has been added there for easy and medium.

levels: tweak Map23 exit.

This is a mandatory damage exit that could kill someone even if they do everything else (more or less) right in beating this map. Worst case scenario, they "learn" from their "mistake", "realize" this is a "fake exit", and spend forever trying to find the "real" exit before giving up and learning much later that they'd actually found it before.

- You can pick up at least 30 health right next to the exit teleporter pad.
- The actual teleport landing itself is not a hurtfloor. It is, however, extremely narrow and right in front of an ambushing trilobite. The only way to dodge its fireball is down.
- Made the exit portal huge and fireblu and not a St. Peter's cross (which is often used elsewhere as a purely decorative thing).
- The "EXIT" map lines are now actually faintly glowing on the floor.

As an additional bonus edit: if you exit without finding that creepy area in the facility and have all those guys warp in, those un-warped guys are now all free to roam the entire area as soon as you fall off that high ledge. This means the necromancers can go into that crowd of zombies and raise them, as well as close range to attack you. Enjoy this epic battle - or panicked rush for the exit.

17 September 2023

Geek's island has weird rules. The king of the island ordered that if the price of any item is even then, it can only be used by boys, and if the price is odd, it can only be used by girls.
A person can only buy one type of item else he/she is punished.
The gender of a person on the island  can be determined by the type of item which he/she bought.
Geek bought exactly two items, the cost of which is A and B respectively. 
Return "He" if Geek is a boy, return "She" if Geek is a girl else return "Punished" if Gender cannot be determined.

 

Example 1:

Input:
A = 3, B = 7
Output: 
She
Explanation: 
Both are odd.
Example 2:

Input:
A = 2, B = 5
Output: 
Punished
Explanation: 
A is even and B is odd.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function solve( ) which takes integers A and B as input parameters and returns the answer as a string.

Constraints:
1 ≤ A , B ≤ 10^9

intro story, telling the tale of humans and monsters, which shortly
thereafter leads into 201X, and Chara (Toriel's house has “An old
calendar from 201X.”) falling into the underground.

The second is the waterfall flashback, its contents taking place
immediately after the intro segment, as a voice (Asriel) finds the
fallen child.

And finally, the third takes place in the True Pacifist final boss.
We'll get to it in due course, and it will have its own section, but
let's address the first two. Regarding the intro, the first thought one
might have is that simply, while narratively relevant, is not a diegetic
presentation. However, We know that everything after the “201X” frame is
Chara's memory (from an outside perspective, that is,) and we also know
that UNDERTALE LOVES bringing the non-diegetic, the mechanical, the
game, INTO the narrative. Saving, RPG Stats, hell, even the
NarratorChara. Surely the intro can be as well? On top of this, what
does the intro do for the player, as the player? Well, aside from
setting the tone, the intro gives us some setting backstory. It's all
important context, and it certainly helps… but it being in the intro
sequence is not that important; It's all presented throughout the game
via diegetic signs, books, and expositional tortoise war heroes/angry
fish guardswomen. The second half is how Chara fell to the underground,
and while also setting tone and informing the player how their character
arrived. It also creates the false impression for the player that their
character is Frisk, feeding into UNDERTALE's meta narrative; “You are
not your character, and their happy ending is not yours.” If we weren't
playing Chara, this would have no narrative impact. The story beat fails
to land by showing us someone elses' character. But, sure. This could be
a purely non-diegetic intro sequence. Simply put, The 201X portion of
the intro sequence does not make sense from a diegetic or a storytelling
perspective unless we play as Chara.

Flashback number two is explicitly a canonical, diegetic flashback. It
occurs when Frisk escapes Undyne by falling down a massive pit… again.
This time, they land in the garbage zone, black out, and have a
flashback sequence of the first time Asriel found Chara. While serving
the main narrative by setting up Asriel as a character, furthering the
final twist of the meta narrative's pacifist route, and neatly
transitioning between overworld areas, it's also very explicitly
diegetic and cannot be dismissed as an intro sequence. With this in
mind, one question is raised. Why do we see this flashback? If the
player character is Frisk, this makes little sense, why would we see
someone else's flashback and not our own? Same thing applies for a Third
Entity, but even more abstract and illogical. What even are we? Sure,
you could say Chara is somehow attached to us/Frisk and that somehow we
get a flashback from Chara who is somehow knocked unconscious by Frisk
also being knocked unconscious. I used the word somehow three times.
That's not good storytelling. A simpler answer, at least in my view, is
that We Are Chara. When Frisk is knocked unconscious, we, being
ostensibly linked to them as a Spirit/Ghost/Reincarnation/Possessing
Dead Frisk/Demon/Insert fan-theory here/SOUL Fragment, have our only
connection to the world temporarily disabled, rendering us effectively
unconscious and prompting a flashback. Nothing weird with multiple
entities or memory sharing. The waterfall flashback is simply our
memory. Simple. The simplest answers are usually the correct ones.

<details>
<summary>DO NOT RESEARCH</summary>
The third sequence is a connection/extension of the first two, displayed
when we SAVE “Someone Else” during the true pacifist battle with Asriel.
To refresh everyone, here is the direct quotes, taken from the Wiki:


[SAVE]: Someone Else
Strangely, as your friends remembered you... Something else began
resonating within the SOUL, stronger and stronger. It seems that there's
still one last person that needs to be saved. But who...? ... Suddenly,
you realize. You reach out and call their name.
Asriel: “Huh? What are you doing...?”
s
It's at this point that the sequence plays. There's no narration, but we
see the sequence of interactions between Asriel and Chara. There are no
panels (except for the first) that don't contain the both of them.
Following this, we get:

You feel your friends' SOULs resonating within ASRIEL! [This is the
generic flavour text for saving all 6, before “Someone Else”, and
appears at the asterisk above as well]
[SAVE]: Asriel Dreemurr
Asriel:
> “Wh... what did you do...?”
“What's this feeling…? What's happening to me?”
Etc. etc. let me win…
During my first and consecutive playthroughs of UNDERTALE, I came to the
conclusion that Asriel's soul still “Had Some Chara In It.” Saving
“Someone Else” was saving Chara, and then you save Asriel Dreemurr after
the story sequence.

This interpretation no longer feels particularly potent to me, but in
the spirit of completeness I'll address it alongside the more reasonable
“You just save Asriel.” Assuming for a moment though, that we do “Save
Chara”, it's not unreasonable to assume that some of Chara's ‘essence'
(or whatever) was merged with Asriel's and by SAVING them, we're SAVING
the part of them that's inside Asriel.

But I don't like that theory.

Let's talk about SAVING Asriel for a moment.

What is the motivation for doing that? Why would we, in universe, wish
to SAVE him, something that the narration explicitly prompts us to do?
He tried and probably succeeded to kill us, at least once, he wants to
reset the entire timeline, he wants to erase all our friendships, all
our progress.

So, why? Well, it's simple. He's our brother. And we know better than
anyone that he's worth saving. And at the very least, there's something
about Frisk (who appears to have absolutely no personality) that reminds
him of Chara, of us. This is, by his own admission, weird;

Asriel:
“Frisk… You really ARE different from Chara. In fact, though you have
similar, uh, fashion choices… I don't know why I ever acted as if you
were the same person.”

To summarise.

The player SAVING Asriel Dreemurr works best if they are Chara, it
becomes Chara encouraging Frisk to SAVE Asriel too.

Asriel recognises Frisk as Chara throughout the True Pacifist battle
(And Beyond), despite his own admission that this is basically
unfounded. Something is causing this recognition.

In Alphys' true lab, there lies a dusty TV and a stack of VHSes. On
them, lie some of the last words Chara had ever heard from their father.

[Asgore] Chara! You have to stay determined! You can't give up... You
are the future of humans and monsters...

These tapes are not the first time they are heard. Sleeping in Toriel's
guest bed, we dream about them. Suffering a fatal injury, they echo in
our ears. Watching the tape is yet another reveal. It's the chilling
truth that in fact, the words we (if we die a lot) are so familiar with,
are in fact the words we hear on our deathbed.

Storytelling-wise, this reveal; like all the others, fails if we do not
play as Chara.

Aside from Asriel's dialogue, Chara's genocide Narration, and the coffin
in Asgore's basement, this is the only time we hear Chara's name. That
and, this following exchange.

[Flowey]
Hi.
…
Monsters have returned to the surface
Peace and prosperity will rule across the land.
…
Well.
There is one last thing.
…
One being with the power to erase EVERYTHING…
…
I'm talking about YOU.
…
So, please.
Just let them go.
Let Frisk be happy.
…
Well, that's all.
See you later…
Chara.
This, I think, is pretty explicitly definitive. Flowey comes to you. To
us. Tells us to take a deep breath and leave the happy ending intact,
then bids us farewell by our own name.

Regardless of anything else, this definitively proves Chara is the
entity with the power to reset everything by the end of True Pacifist
(Which is a power we have). Flowey positively identifies us as “Chara”,
despite his mistake we discussed in 3C. He's not talking to Frisk,
because he refers to them in the third person.

He is talking to Us. Chara.

I don't want to discuss Flowey's use of “Chara” in Genocide all that
much, because the counter-argument is blindingly simple.

“By the time Flowey first says that name, Chara has overtaken Frisk by
feeding on the power we create for them.”

Of course, under PlayerChara, Flowey's lines still make sense, and
arguably more.

Implications
At this point, I believe the evidence is sufficient to support the
theory. With this in mind, I want to discuss the implications this has
on the narrative and meta-narrative. This is where all those funny
glossary terms come into play.

The pacifist route in UNDERTALE, as discussed above, is textually quite
simple when accepting PlayerChara. The meta-text is also relatively
simple. Meta textually, the Pacifist Route is a dissection of the
suspension of disbelief, examining how we emotionally place ourselves
within fictional worlds, and are often-times torn away from those worlds
as the game comes to an end, left wanting the true emotional connection,
wanting a happy ending that cannot be good enough for us because we're
real and it's not. The reflection of this meta narrative in the textual
narrative, quite naturally flows. We, Chara, want a happy ending. But we
can't have it, it's not our happy ending. We're gone. We've been gone a
long time. Frisk's happy ending can't be good enough for us, because we
won't be around to see it. So, we're left with a choice.

To let Frisk live happily? To accept an ending that might leave us
emotionally wanting, yet preserves our emotional journey?

To reset? To refuse an ending and satiate our emotional emptiness, yet
destroy that very emotional journey we took in the process?

The choice is the same. There is practically no separation between the
diegetic and the meta.

“Can a happy ending be good enough for you?” This question applies to
us, as the real world player running UNDERTALE.exe on our computer, and
us, Chara, the long deceased human who can do little but watch as Frisk
lives the life they wish they still had, or can destroy everything for a
hollow mimicry of that very life.

This message, however, breaks down under one specific circumstance.
Where we force a Third Entity into the mix. This one decision fractures
the cohesion and creates a meta-textually dissonant mess. Now, all of a
sudden, “Can a happy ending be good enough for you?” no longer runs
parallel through both narratives. There is no reason for the Player
Entity to wish to remain, the happy ending should automatically be good
enough because it's the happy ending. Meanwhile, Chara, despite being an
inextricable representation of “A happy ending I can't achieve,” gets
absolutely nothing to do with this meta-narrative because they're just…
not you.

“we are mario in Super Mario 64, but when he says "Thank you so much for
playing my game!" that doesn't mean we aren't still playing as mario” -
PopitTart

This is where things get weird. See, in the Genocide route.. Well, we
see Chara. On Screen. Talk to us.

Now, it can easily be argued that this completely shatters the theory,
but I would disagree. I'm going to endeavour to present a textual
explanation (or two) for this. But first, I want to dissect the
meta-text here.

Now, I'm sure the idea that “The Genocide Route's Meta-Narratve is
Fading Emotional Investment and the way emotional connection with video
games can lead to the very sabotage of that emotional connection” is not
revolutionary. However, what's conspicuously absent from all of the
third entity theorising is the way that this meta-text is mirrored in
the textual narrative.

Once satisfied with a game, having extracted all lines of dialogue and
stat boosts, once reaching all endings, a user will close the game down.
And at some point, perhaps to make room for a new game or perhaps on a
new device, will leave the game uninstalled, either deliberately, or
simply as a consequence of time.

Textually, what happens in the Genocide ending?
Now we have reached the absolute.
There is nothing left for us here.
Let us erase this pointless world, and move on to the next.

The world is destroyed. So much is left unanswered here.
Who is Chara talking to?
Where did Frisk go?
How do they have this much power?
Why would they want this?
If we ‘corrupted' them, what the hell does that even mean?
What is Chara?
For now, let's talk about who Chara is talking to.

The simplest answer is “Perspective switch.” Suddenly, we're not Chara
anymore, now we are Frisk. This meets all the dialogue options and even
vaguely mirrors the meta-text. It also manages to avoid bringing a third
entity along and so is automatically better! But, I find myself still
not fully enjoying this idea.

Remember what I said about Occam's Razor?

I think there's another option. One that doesn't involve three entities,
or even two entities, just Chara. One that mirrors the meta-text to a
degree only Toby Fox could pull off. It's a weird one, and I don't fault
you if you don't get it on your first read, but bear with me here,
because things are about to get

A little
Fucking
Abstract

Let's discard any and all pre-concieved notions of anything and hold one
singular truth above all else. “Chara Is The Player.” What does this
mean for this cutscene?

Well… it means the player is talking to…

THe player?

It also neatly answers the question of motive, so let's throw that out
the skeleton-shaped hole in the window for now.

If the player is talking to the player, this frames Chara's words in a
whole new light.

Every time a number increases, that feeling… That's me. “Chara.”

This line becomes explicitly literal. The Chara on-screen is literally
the player's feeling of satisfaction watching stat increases. But this
is all meta-textual, right? What does this mean for the textual
narrative?

Here's the thing. It can't mean anything, yet means everything.

There is no way to reconcile the fact that a Textually Real character is
directly talking about what the player feels when playing a game to
completion. The barrier between Meta and Textual no longer exists. It
can't. Not here. And with this revelation, everything begins to make
sense.

Your power awakened me from death.

Our power. Our desire to complete UNDERTALE awakens Chara from death.
They become startlingly real. We imbue this fictional character with the
real world desire to consume fiction, destroying enemies and worlds as
we go, increasing our power and our stats. Video Game Accomplishments.
And UNDERTALE has just finished being consumed.

My “human soul”... My “determination”... They were not mine, but YOURS.

Chara, the textual player, acknowledges the meta-textual player's
control over the game world. A control that we surrendered. By engaging
in UNDERTALE in a fully immersed way, we have fed the Diegetic character
that is our player character, Chara. This has continued until we haul
ourself out of the Internal Mode and into the External Mode, revoking
our immersion to make the consumption of content easier, to distance
ourself from the killing.

Raising our LV.

The more we distance ourselves, the less real UNDERTALE's world appears
to us. Once it's done, we're ready to erase this pointless world and
move onto the next. There's just one problem. UNDERTALE knows about us.
It knows we exist and it will abuse that to convey meaning. By revoking
our immersion in UNDERTALE, we end up shattering the barrier between
Meta and Textual, and this occurs because revoking our immersion is a
diegetic decision. Without this barrier, WE, as a character, gain
control of UNDERTALE and use this external mode control to

Erase the world. To uninstall.


This code doesn't actually work, of course. That was pretty obvious by
the fact that it didn't delete your game. But still, this exists in the
code that makes the game window shake when Chara attacks it. This is,
quite literally, intent for Chara to delete UNDERTALE. If you didn't
think Chara was capable of uninstalling your game before, you should
now.

Who is chara talking to?

Us.
How do hey have this much power?

We gave it to them. We Are them, and we deleted UNDERTALE when we were
done with it.
Why would they want this?

We wanted to move onto a new game.
What is Chara?

Us. ( I'll come back to this.)
But wait! What about soulless pacifist?
Well, at that point, you've surrendered Frisk's SOUL to Chara, as in,
you the real player has revoked your emotional attachment to UNDERTALE
and accepted that Chara can have control over the game. You've revoked
your immersion AS Chara, you no longer see yourself a Chara and as such
Chara becomes their own being. You've surrendered, basically. But they
let you play through it. Because why not. You might get attached again,
but that's fine. All that means is that the happy ending that was once
Frisk's, that you, the player, and you, Chara, both once lamented not
being able to live, has now been surrendered to Chara. A warped,
completionist, Chara.

You don't get your happy ending. But Chara does.

You don't even get the solace of knowing someone gets their happy
ending. Because Chara gets it.

Frankly, outside of being “The Player”, I don't think the exact nature
of “Chara” is that crucial. My personal thought is that they're a SOUL
fragment, absorbed by Frisk when they fell on Chara's grave (Frisk could
absorb a human SOUL fragment because said fragment was part monster
SOUL). This fragment gives Frisk the final edge of determination needed
to SAVE.

But, ultimately, that's little more than a fanfiction. And frankly, I
think that's okay. Not everything needs to be impenetrable, as long as
there's enough there to build a stable foundation.

I'd also like to address the nature of SAVING quickly, specifically the
normal version, not the Asriel fight version. People have asked “Why do
we save if it's Frisk's SOUL.” There could be many reasons. Frisk might
just defer control to us. Because we're pushing Frisk over that
Determination limit, we might be privileged to have that control.

Balance: Removes anti-drop implants for nukies (#78275)

## About The Pull Request

Removes anti-drop implants being available in nukie implants. Also
rebalances the cybernetic implants bundle to cost 20 TC (value of 24 TC)
since anti-drop has been removed from it.

## Why It's Good For The Game

This is one of the rare few nerf PRs where I was not the one who got
KILLED by the broken OP shit but rather the one using it. I recently
played a nukie round (after hearing that anti-drop had been added) where
I took modsuit shield, dsword, and anti-drop. I got separated from my
team and then proceeded to solo murderbone half the fucking station,
resist MULTIPLE disarms that would have otherwise been successful, get
the disk alone, and nuke. I only had to stop to heal _once_ and honestly
I probably would have been fine if I didn't.

Anti-drop dsword is _insanely_ powerful. Shielded dsword nukies were
already strong enough but were at least somewhat balanced insofar as
there were several ways you could still reliably disarm them and
therefore open them up to more attacks. But now (after
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/77330 which added the
anti-drop implants to nukie uplink) you can have shielded anti-drop
dsword nukies. Add stims and some explosives to deal with any static
fortifications the crew might make (like firelock crush relays), and
with a semi-robust player you essentially have a murderbone machine who
can't be killed by any regularly accessible crew counters short of point
blank suicide bombing. We should not have a default nukie loadout that
can only be reliably, regularly countered by a fucking bomb. Especially
since the crew's main easily accessible ballistic is now being nerfed as
well. (https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/78235)

EDIT: I'd also like to point out that we already don't allow hulks to
use dswords for many of the same reasons.

## Changelog

balance: removed anti-drop implants from the nuclear operative uplink

Nuclear Operative Jump Jets (#78088)

## About The Pull Request

This PR gives operative MODsuits access to "jump jets".
This is an activated module (starts pinned) with a 30 second cooldown
which removes your personal gravity for 5 seconds and (if possible)
pushes you upwards by one z level. In combination with your regular
jetpack this allows you to fly over gaps, and (most importantly) out of
pits such as you may inadvertently find yourself wandering into on
Icebox.
I have a few other changes I want to make specifically targetted at the
experience of Icebox station destruction causing people to fall several
z levels and get trapped, but this is the first one.

You have to stand still for 1 second to activate the jump jet. This is
because jetpack movement without gravity is actually usually faster than
an operative will walk, and I don't want them to just toggle it as a
sprint button while running around. If people find other tactical uses
for this though I think that's cool.

This module currently isn't available to crew on the tech web, although
maybe someone could add it later if they wanted to. It's not quite so
useful if you don't _also_ have a jetpack though.
I bumped the available complexity of the suits I attached it to up by
the complexity cost of this module so it's not taking up previously
available space.

## Why It's Good For The Game

It's funny when the whole ops team falls in a hole after an explosion
they caused and gets stuck in there fighting Snow Legions but they
should probably have some method for dealing with that.
It also lets them pop back up from the tram hole, a risky proposition
because any flying mob hit by the tram dies almost instantly.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Operative MODsuits now have an attached "jump jet" which sends you
upwards and allows you to use your jetpack under gravity for a few
seconds, perfect for navigating the pits and valleys of Icebox Station.

Aspiring users are warned that it's really bad for trying to actually
kill people. Caveat emptor.
add: Guns now have a dry_fire_sound_volume variable, allowing for guns
to be less loud when trying to fire while empty.
fix: Closets and crates now properly count as structures for pass flags
again.

Grilles take 0-1 damage when shocking something, power sinks are available at lower reputation (#77860)

## About The Pull Request
Ports BeeStation/BeeStation-Hornet#3590. As it is right now, it's
trivial to set up a contraption using a conveyor belt and a shocked
grille to continuously shock monkey bodies. While this is very funny, it
also serves as a ghetto powersink that's hard to locate, easy to
replicate, and lasts effectively forever, since you can just keep
shocking the same bodies over and over again.

This doesn't completely remove the ability to make these, but it makes
them require at least a little maintenance and provides a way for them
to stop working even if the crew isn't able to locate them.

In an attempt to finally get people using the _actual_ powersink,
they'll show up a bit earlier in progression now. I'm not convinced 20
minutes is enough, but I don't want to put them in early enough that it
fucks with Engineering's ability to set things up at round start. We can
turn this down further if need be.

I'm also up for turning the TC requirement down, but 11 feels about
right for what they're supposed to do, so I'd prefer we try this first
and see how that works.

## Why It's Good For The Game
I'm all for goofy weird shit players have found, but there's an issue
with being able to do what an antag item is supposed to do but just
plain better. This shouldn't make creating these impossible or make them
unusable, but it'll require players to actively monitor them if they
want it to run for an extended period.

Additionally, we don't really see powersinks much anymore, and while
that might be more because powernets are kind of buggy and unreliable, I
think making them easier to get will make them show up a little more.

## Changelog
:cl: Vekter
balance: Grilles will now take 0-1 damage every time they shock
something.
balance: Powersinks are now available earlier in traitor progression.

Fix crash from Lua prompts when exiting the game completely

The problem is that Engine outlives GameController and thus also LuaScriptInterface. The solution is to not try to access LSI's lua_State if it doesn't exist; this is the case in Engine's dtor.

This is ugly as hell and the root of the problem is the cursed ownership model of LuaComponents and Windows by Engine, which I don't think I'll be fixing any time soon.

Misc mapping fixes and QoL additions (#78176)

## About The Pull Request

fix: #78135
fix: #78059

This PR remaps Birdshot's disposals room, makes several small fixes on
Icebox and Metastation, adds cell timers to isolation cells where such
cells are present (they don't open the door, effectively just an in-game
timer) (in-cell flashes are now controlled with the timer, where
applicable); and adds translator glove modules to the stacks of
"accessibility" modules found in most security, medical, and engineering
storage rooms. (adds these stacks in their entirety to Northstar).

Specific changes are as follows:
Birdshot
- Adds a roll of package paper to the cargo office
- Translator module [med,sec]
- Accessibility modules [eng]
- Recycler remap

Delta
- Translator module [med,sec,eng]
- Isolation cell timer

Icebox
- Translator module [med,sec,eng]
- Remove duplicate hand labeler on the rack near brig cells
- Adds a hand labeler to armory desk in gear room
- Isolation cell timer

Meta
- Translator module [med,sec,eng]
- Isolation cell timer
- Mends a broken corpse disposal pipe from aux surgery to the morgue

Northstar
- Accessibility modules [med,sec,eng]
- Nudges the binoculars off of the mass driver controls in ordnance
- Fixes the SM starting out hotwired (Rewires the SM room)

Tram
- Translator module [med,sec,eng]
- Isolation cell timers
## Why It's Good For The Game

Bug fixes with respect to Birdshot's recycler, Meta's corpse disposal,
Northstar starting out hotwired, and Icebox's duplicated hand labeler.

Nudging Northstar's ordnance binoculars should make it a bit easier to
find the mass driver controls.

Adding some packaging paper to Birdshot to make the techs' lives a
little easier with a little less round-start fuss.

Adding a hand labeler to Icebox's gear room brings it in line with other
maps in terms of rounds-start gear and locker labeling potential.

For players with characters running the Mute/Signer quirks, stock
MODsuits are a pain to use. Suit gauntlets will replace their translator
gloves. Unless they're able to get a suit put together ahead of time,
they'll be stuck doing the retract gauntlets > send radio message >
Extend Gauntlets shuffle. Adding a translator glove module to the stack
of similar items (plasma fixation module / therma regulator) should
alleviate that issue some.

Getting abandoned in an isolation cell sucks, and setting timers on your
phone or some such is a hassle. Adding cell timers to isolation cells
should go some way to alleviating those frustrations.

M707 "Vulture" Anti-Materiel Rifle (#4253)

# About the pull request

## The M707 is not made player-accessible in this PR.

Adds the M707 "Vulture" anti-materiel rifle to the game. [Design doc
here.](https://github.com/cmss13-devs/cmss13/files/12433899/M707_Final.pdf)

The M707 is meant to take the place of a heavy support weapon, not
unlike the mortar. It is a 20mm bolt-action rifle, capable of loading
from 4-round magazines. Each round does 400 damage with full AP (50),
but it is not a simple task to fire the weapon. The gun, being as
high-caliber as it is, will immediately break your arm & hand if you do
not fire it without use of the built-in bipod. In addition, its accuracy
is massively reduced below its ideal range (10 tiles), which means the
scope is necessary to be used.

The scope does not function like a regular scope. (see screenshot
section for details) Instead, it shows a 5x5 area (the rest is blacked
out) 12 tiles ahead, with an aiming reticle in the center. The aiming
reticle will drift over time within the 5x5, requiring you to re-adjust
or use the **Hold Breath** ability to temporarily stop the sway. If you
open up the scope's UI, you will be able to modify the scope and the
reticle's location, one tile at a time, very slowly.

To assist with this, the Vulture comes with a spotting scope & tripod. A
secondary user is able to assemble and use the spotting scope. The scope
is a complement to the Vulture's, allowing a communicative team to
become far more effective. The spotter's view, on use, will be locked to
the location of the Vulture scope. However, the spotter's view is not
locked to a 5x5 area, instead getting a view of the full area, on top of
an extra 2 tiles (in each direction) of view range. Finally, both the
spotter and sniper's scopes have night vision equivalent to an SG's
goggles.

The bullet itself is a powerful beast. Powerful enough to pierce walls,
people, and barricades, but with 2 caveats. The first is that every
wall/cade penetration removes 75 damage from the round, and any
cades/tables that the round passes over will be immediately destroyed by
the round. In addition, anyone in a large range will hear the report of
the rifle sound and the direction it came from.

Update as of 8/31:
Vulture and its spotter scope now require a pamphlet to use (a pamphlet
gives the trait needed to use both), guncase spawns with 2.

# Explain why it's good for the game

It's a unique weapon that encourages communication inside a team, while
simultaneously not contributing to the IFF ungaball. The weapon promotes
thoughtful gameplay and repositioning to be able to hit a target without
friendlies getting in the way or getting overrun.

Mention how long each course day is (#1155)

Most classes run with 2.5 hours for the morning session and 2.5 hours
for the afternoon session.

I have tried running the course as 2 × 2.5 hours and 2 × 3 hours. My
experience was that people ended up getting really worn out after
spending 6 hours in total on Rust (7 hours including a lunch break).
However, the experience varies from group to group, so this is just a
recommendation.

Add LabelStudio integration (#8880)

This PR introduces [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/) integration
with LangChain via `LabelStudioCallbackHandler`:

- sending data to the Label Studio instance
- labeling dataset for supervised LLM finetuning
- rating model responses
- tracking and displaying chat history
- support for custom data labeling workflow

### Example

```
chat_llm = ChatOpenAI(callbacks=[LabelStudioCallbackHandler(mode="chat")])
chat_llm([
    SystemMessage(content="Always use emojis in your responses."),
        HumanMessage(content="Hey AI, how's your day going?"),
    AIMessage(content="🤖 I don't have feelings, but I'm running smoothly! How can I help you today?"),
        HumanMessage(content="I'm feeling a bit down. Any advice?"),
    AIMessage(content="🤗 I'm sorry to hear that. Remember, it's okay to seek help or talk to someone if you need to. 💬"),
        HumanMessage(content="Can you tell me a joke to lighten the mood?"),
    AIMessage(content="Of course! 🎭 Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field! 🌾"),
        HumanMessage(content="Haha, that was a good one! Thanks for cheering me up."),
    AIMessage(content="Always here to help! 😊 If you need anything else, just let me know."),
        HumanMessage(content="Will do! By the way, can you recommend a good movie?"),
])
```

#### Sunday 2023-09-17 21:39:03 by DETrooper

Faith Library & Command Fixes

	- Added /CharTransferFaith command.
	- Added an argument to the cwMelee PlayerStabilityFallover and TakeStability functions to not use a /me. Used this to override it with a new message when shocked by the Voltcave doors.
	- Added flavor text for flagellating oneself with a bellhammer, along with making it ring properly.
	- Admin chat logs in console are now correctly affected by the 'Imbecile' trait.
	- Admins can now open blastdoors from observer without being the correct faction. This would be redundant because the Tower doors all have levers, but it also applies to the Voltcave.
	- Cash weight/space now defaults to false in the config.
	- Damaging siege ladders (that aren't your own) now confers a small amount of XP.
	- Fixed /CharUnpermakill not working for characters in the SQL of non-connected players or for unloaded characters of connected players.
	- Fixed /radio not working when standing near a stationary radio.
	- Fixed /radioproclaim not working for non-admins who otherwise meet its requirements of character rank.
	- Fixed an issue where skins applied in character creation for non-wanderer characters wouldn't appear on the character preview.
	- Fixed belief tree completion bonus text using the parent belief tree's color instead of being green.
	- Fixed engraved weapons not displaying their new name in the weapon selection UI. Also fixed shield names not showing up in the weapons selection text either.
	- Fixed insane and unconcious characters being able to hear radios and belief-based chats like darkwhisper or relay. Also fixed them being able to hear some scripted /mes.
	- Fixed lua error with javelins causing them to not do damage.
	- Fixed talking to your possessor not being influenced by the 'Imbecile' trait.
	- Fixed the 'Jack of All Trades' belief locking tier 4 subfaith beliefs.
	- Gorewatch doors can now be opened by Gatekeepers of any rank.
	- Gunshot wounds will now only apply if the damage taken was at or above 30 HP.
	- Improved logic for talking over radios.
	- Kinisgers disguised as a high enough Gatekeeper rank or as Holy Hierarchy can now proclaim and radioproclaim.
	- Moved faiths to their own library, making it easier to add or modify them.
	- Removed /CharBan and /CharUnban since their functionality has been superceded with the permakill system.
	- Renamed /CharTransfer command to /CharTransferFaction.

JUDGEMENT & SALVATION
 65 “I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me; I was found by those who did not seek me. 
To a nation that did not call on my name, I said, ‘Here am I, here am I.’ 
2 All day long I have held out my hands to an obstinate people, who walk in ways not good, pursuing their own imaginations— 
3 a people who continually provoke me to my very face, offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on altars of brick; 
4 who sit among the graves and spend their nights keeping secret vigil; who eat the flesh of pigs, and whose pots hold broth of impure meat;
 5 who say, ‘Keep away; don’t come near me, for I am too sacred for you!’ Such people are smoke in my nostrils, a fire that keeps burning all day. 
6 “See, it stands written before me: I will not keep silent but will pay back in full; I will pay it back into their laps— 
7 both your sins and the sins of your ancestors,” says the Lord. “Because they burned sacrifices on the mountains and defied me on the hills, I will measure into their laps the full payment for their former deeds.” 
8 This is what the Lord says: “As when juice is still found in a cluster of grapes and people say, ‘Don’t destroy it, there is still a blessing in it,’ so will I do in behalf of my servants; I will not destroy them all. 
9 I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, and from Judah those who will possess my mountains; my chosen people will inherit them, and there will my servants live. 
10 Sharon will become a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds, for my people who seek me. 
11 “But as for you who forsake the Lord and forget my holy mountain, who spread a table for Fortune and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny, 
12 I will destine you for the sword, and all of you will fall in the slaughter; for I called but you did not answer, I spoke but you did not listen. You did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me.” 
13 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: “My servants will eat, but you will go hungry; my servants will drink, but you will go thirsty; my servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame. 
14 My servants will sing out of the joy of their hearts, but you will cry out from anguish of heart and wail in brokenness of spirit. 
15 You will leave your name for my chosen ones to use in their curses; the Sovereign Lord will put you to death, but to his servants he will give another name. 
16 Whoever invokes a blessing in the land will do so by the one true God; whoever takes an oath in the land will swear by the one true God. For the past troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my eyes. New Heavens and a New Earth 
17 “See, I will create new heavens and a new earth. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind.
 18 But be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create, for I will create Jerusalem to be a delight and its people a joy. 
19 I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people; the sound of weeping and of crying will be heard in it no more. 
20 “Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not live out his years; the one who dies at a hundred will be thought a mere child; the one who fails to reach[a] a hundred will be considered accursed. 
21 They will build houses and dwell in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit. 
22 No longer will they build houses and others live in them, or plant and others eat. For as the days of a tree, so will be the days of my people; my chosen ones will long enjoy the work of their hands. 
23 They will not labor in vain, nor will they bear children doomed to misfortune; for they will be a people blessed by the Lord, they and their descendants with them. 
24 Before they call I will answer; while they are still speaking I will hear. 
25 The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, and dust will be the serpent’s food. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain,” says the Lord.
Hallelujah & praise God. 
Isaiah has been coded out. 
I am going to listen to that again. God bless & keep you & heal your diseases & answer your fervent prayers as you trust in Him fully. I love you all!

Completely changes how DCS types works (#5911)

DCS now registers based on its registered type, as opposed to at every
subtype.
Dupe mode is no longer considered realistically usable unless
if-and-only-if all var pre-setting behavior is considered - which is not
the case on the majority of citrp-made components outside of
/datum/component/radioactive

## Why?

Components are a generic way to attach datums to things.
The common practices included:
- No getcomponent
- Use signals for all interaction
- Don't subtype, set vars on initialization

This resulted in components, while being quite stable, being also quite
rigid, in my opinion. Given we don't use components for the same things,
and probably never will, I think it's better for us to get the
optimizations from not supporting what's honestly behavior that we
shouldn't rely on in the first place - if something needs to be applied
multiple times (e.g. radiation) it should rely on the old behavior and
this new system still allows it. If it doesn't, the author should either
not be adding the component multiple times, or **making** their
component functional under this system. InheritComponent still has all
the tools necessary to properly do component inheritance, it's just now
we default to all components only being considered the same if it's the
exact subtype - which from what I could see, is also the previous case
(as if you add a subtype, uh, bad shit's going to happen if the base
type is registered but not the subtype anyways!)

Let Slip the Dogs of War (#5905)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## The Machines Rise
With the recent sector wide hack rogue synthetics have become a problem
in the sector. What's worse now corrupted fabricators are even building
more combat designs! With an increasingly dangerous galaxy, it seems
that mercenaries will not be the only threat brave explorers and
security teams may face today. All security forces are advised to stay
on the lookout for the latest threat to the galaxy, and those not
equipped to take them on are advised, stay well out range!

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game
As we want to move away for humanoid threats for simple mobs, I feel it
necessary to shore up killer machines as more advanced type of enemy to
take the place of humans in terms of 'dangerous opponents'. The current
selection of machines mobs tend to be more niche in function (we can't
exactly use the nanite horror as common enemies). Also there is a bigger
maint drone now because the smaller ones weren't bad enough, least these
ones are easier to hit.

<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,
especially if they are controversial and/or far reaching. If you can't
actually explain WHY what you are doing will improve the game, then it
probably isn't good for the game in the first place. -->

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. You can read up on GBP
and it's effects on PRs in the tgstation guides for contributors. Please
note that maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags
should they deem it appropriate. You can attempt to finagle the system
all you want, but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off
the bat. -->

:cl:
add: 4 New Hostile Drones, Three Dogs (including one sniper), and a
Maint Drone.
add: New News article elaborating on recent events.
tweak: drones are now part of the same faction as hivebots. This means
evil bots will now cooperate (Hivebots are being updated next).
/:cl:

<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put
your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your
GitHub username as author ingame. -->
<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the
icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags,
changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by
the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->

buffs embed pulling with hemostats, allows wirecutters to pull embeds too (#78256)

## About The Pull Request
- Wirecutters or tools with wirecutter behaviors are now valid for
plucking embeds.
- Pluck speed no longer **starts** at 2.5 seconds, which is a pretty
dang long time, especially if you have bad embed RNG. I'll do the math
and run some more tests in the morning.
- Wirecutters have a speed malus in regards to plucking embeds. I should
probably make it worse to account for, like, jaws of life or something.
- Plucking embeds with wirecutters now hurts! It hurts way less than
ripping it out with your hands, but it still hurts!

For comparison's sake, bare-handed throwing star removal compared to
possible tools.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Embeds kinda suck to deal with. This is intentional - I get that.

However, hemostat pulling is kind of... kind of bad. Awful, really. 2.5
seconds is a lot of time. I know it's not supposed to be the best
option, but if you've got a tool, I'd at least like to think it'd be
slightly less bad than shoving your fingers into your wound?

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: Pulling embedded items e.g. shrapnel with hemostats is now a
lot faster, and scales appropriately with toolspeed.
balance: You can now pull embedded items with wirecutters, at a speed
penalty.
/:cl:
