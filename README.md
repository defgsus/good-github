mpy/QSTR: Make nvs & rtcmem USER_C_MODULES

This affects the following components:
- RTC memory driver
- NVS driver
- Micropython module for NVS
- Micropython module for RTC memory
- Micropython module for external modules

It looks like previously most of the badgePython C code for interfacing
with Python were implemented as "extmod"s in MicroPython.  From a
maintenance perspective MicroPython intends an "extmod" to live within
the MicroPython codebase, but be something which affects multiple
ports... for example the use of mbedTLS or TinyUSB.

To clarify the relationship between badgePython and MicroPython, lets
review part of the MicroPython documentation: [Implementing a
Module][1]:

> This chapter details how to implement a core module in MicroPython.
> MicroPython modules can be one of the following:
>
> -   Built-in module: A general module that is be part of the MicroPython
>     repository.
> -   User module: A module that is useful for your specific project that
>     you maintain in your own repository or private codebase.
> -   Dynamic module: A module that can be deployed and imported at
>     runtime to your device.
>
> A module in MicroPython can be implemented in one of the following
> locations:
>
> -   py/: A core library that mirrors core CPython functionality.
> -   extmod/: A CPython or MicroPython-specific module that is shared
>     across multiple ports.
> -   ports/<port>/: A port-specific module.

Clearly a "User module" is the most appropriate term for what we are
trying to implment.  This commit migrates `nvs` and `driver_rtcmem` to
be "User modules" and moves them into the `components` directory.

To understand what this sort of change entails, let's review the
MicroPython documentation for "Extending MicroPython in C", specifically
"[Compiling the cmodule into MicroPython][2]".

In my opinion the MicroPython documentation fails to drive a very
important point home:

`USER_C_MODULES` mechanism implemented in MicroPython expects to receive
a CMake script which then uses `include()` to enumerate all of the project
modules as CMake scripts (as a specific path) or CMake modules (found via
searching for the module in the locations specified in the
`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` CMake variable).  This is why this commit adds the
file `components/external_micropy_modules.cmake`.  It allows the end
user to specify the modules that the specifically wish to import into
the MicroPython firmware.

In the long run, this will be improved to support the `BOARDS` mechanism
allowing for easy driver selection, integrated in with Kconfig.

Next, for each of our drivers we add a CMake script which will allow
MicroPython to execute the QSTR macro generation process.  If you find
yourself troubleshooting missing definitions of `MP_QSTR_` macros, this
is the file to look at.  I'm using a convention of calling the file
`micropy_module.cmake` to distinguish it from the CMake script which
will be used to build the module.

The `micropy_module.cmake` file is a CMake script which defines the
following:

- The components source code as a target of type `INTERFACE`
- The components source directory as an include location of type
  `INTERFACE`
- That this is component should be attached to the `usermod` target as
  an `INTERFACE`.

This is pretty much a rote implementation of the example provided in
the [documentation][2] under "Structure of an external C module".
Towards the end of this section CMake based implementations are
discussed.

bpf: Add fd-based tcx multi-prog infra with link support

This work refactors and adds a lightweight extension ("tcx") to the tc BPF
ingress and egress data path side for allowing BPF program management based
on fds via bpf() syscall through the newly added generic multi-prog API.
The main goal behind this work which we also presented at LPC [0] last year
and a recent update at LSF/MM/BPF this year [3] is to support long-awaited
BPF link functionality for tc BPF programs, which allows for a model of safe
ownership and program detachment.

Given the rise in tc BPF users in cloud native environments, this becomes
necessary to avoid hard to debug incidents either through stale leftover
programs or 3rd party applications accidentally stepping on each others toes.
As a recap, a BPF link represents the attachment of a BPF program to a BPF
hook point. The BPF link holds a single reference to keep BPF program alive.
Moreover, hook points do not reference a BPF link, only the application's
fd or pinning does. A BPF link holds meta-data specific to attachment and
implements operations for link creation, (atomic) BPF program update,
detachment and introspection. The motivation for BPF links for tc BPF programs
is multi-fold, for example:

  - From Meta: "It's especially important for applications that are deployed
    fleet-wide and that don't "control" hosts they are deployed to. If such
    application crashes and no one notices and does anything about that, BPF
    program will keep running draining resources or even just, say, dropping
    packets. We at FB had outages due to such permanent BPF attachment
    semantics. With fd-based BPF link we are getting a framework, which allows
    safe, auto-detachable behavior by default, unless application explicitly
    opts in by pinning the BPF link." [1]

  - From Cilium-side the tc BPF programs we attach to host-facing veth devices
    and phys devices build the core datapath for Kubernetes Pods, and they
    implement forwarding, load-balancing, policy, EDT-management, etc, within
    BPF. Currently there is no concept of 'safe' ownership, e.g. we've recently
    experienced hard-to-debug issues in a user's staging environment where
    another Kubernetes application using tc BPF attached to the same prio/handle
    of cls_bpf, accidentally wiping all Cilium-based BPF programs from underneath
    it. The goal is to establish a clear/safe ownership model via links which
    cannot accidentally be overridden. [0,2]

BPF links for tc can co-exist with non-link attachments, and the semantics are
in line also with XDP links: BPF links cannot replace other BPF links, BPF
links cannot replace non-BPF links, non-BPF links cannot replace BPF links and
lastly only non-BPF links can replace non-BPF links. In case of Cilium, this
would solve mentioned issue of safe ownership model as 3rd party applications
would not be able to accidentally wipe Cilium programs, even if they are not
BPF link aware.

Earlier attempts [4] have tried to integrate BPF links into core tc machinery
to solve cls_bpf, which has been intrusive to the generic tc kernel API with
extensions only specific to cls_bpf and suboptimal/complex since cls_bpf could
be wiped from the qdisc also. Locking a tc BPF program in place this way, is
getting into layering hacks given the two object models are vastly different.

We instead implemented the tcx (tc 'express') layer which is an fd-based tc BPF
attach API, so that the BPF link implementation blends in naturally similar to
other link types which are fd-based and without the need for changing core tc
internal APIs. BPF programs for tc can then be successively migrated from classic
cls_bpf to the new tc BPF link without needing to change the program's source
code, just the BPF loader mechanics for attaching is sufficient.

For the current tc framework, there is no change in behavior with this change
and neither does this change touch on tc core kernel APIs. The gist of this
patch is that the ingress and egress hook have a lightweight, qdisc-less
extension for BPF to attach its tc BPF programs, in other words, a minimal
entry point for tc BPF. The name tcx has been suggested from discussion of
earlier revisions of this work as a good fit, and to more easily differ between
the classic cls_bpf attachment and the fd-based one.

For the ingress and egress tcx points, the device holds a cache-friendly array
with program pointers which is separated from control plane (slow-path) data.
Earlier versions of this work used priority to determine ordering and expression
of dependencies similar as with classic tc, but it was challenged that for
something more future-proof a better user experience is required. Hence this
resulted in the design and development of the generic attach/detach/query API
for multi-progs. See prior patch with its discussion on the API design. tcx is
the first user and later we plan to integrate also others, for example, one
candidate is multi-prog support for XDP which would benefit and have the same
'look and feel' from API perspective.

The goal with tcx is to have maximum compatibility to existing tc BPF programs,
so they don't need to be rewritten specifically. Compatibility to call into
classic tcf_classify() is also provided in order to allow successive migration
or both to cleanly co-exist where needed given its all one logical tc layer and
the tcx plus classic tc cls/act build one logical overall processing pipeline.

tcx supports the simplified return codes TCX_NEXT which is non-terminating (go
to next program) and terminating ones with TCX_PASS, TCX_DROP, TCX_REDIRECT.
The fd-based API is behind a static key, so that when unused the code is also
not entered. The struct tcx_entry's program array is currently static, but
could be made dynamic if necessary at a point in future. The a/b pair swap
design has been chosen so that for detachment there are no allocations which
otherwise could fail.

The work has been tested with tc-testing selftest suite which all passes, as
well as the tc BPF tests from the BPF CI, and also with Cilium's L4LB.

Kudos also to Nikolay Aleksandrov and Martin Lau for in-depth early reviews
of this work.

bpf: Add generic attach/detach/query API for multi-progs

This adds a generic layer called bpf_mprog which can be reused by different
attachment layers to enable multi-program attachment and dependency resolution.
In-kernel users of the bpf_mprog don't need to care about the dependency
resolution internals, they can just consume it with few API calls.

The initial idea of having a generic API sparked out of discussion [0] from an
earlier revision of this work where tc's priority was reused and exposed via
BPF uapi as a way to coordinate dependencies among tc BPF programs, similar
as-is for classic tc BPF. The feedback was that priority provides a bad user
experience and is hard to use [1], e.g.:

  I cannot help but feel that priority logic copy-paste from old tc, netfilter
  and friends is done because "that's how things were done in the past". [...]
  Priority gets exposed everywhere in uapi all the way to bpftool when it's
  right there for users to understand. And that's the main problem with it.

  The user don't want to and don't need to be aware of it, but uapi forces them
  to pick the priority. [...] Your cover letter [0] example proves that in
  real life different service pick the same priority. They simply don't know
  any better. Priority is an unnecessary magic that apps _have_ to pick, so
  they just copy-paste and everyone ends up using the same.

The course of the discussion showed more and more the need for a generic,
reusable API where the "same look and feel" can be applied for various other
program types beyond just tc BPF, for example XDP today does not have multi-
program support in kernel, but also there was interest around this API for
improving management of cgroup program types. Such common multi-program
management concept is useful for BPF management daemons or user space BPF
applications coordinating internally about their attachments.

Both from Cilium and Meta side [2], we've collected the following requirements
for a generic attach/detach/query API for multi-progs which has been implemented
as part of this work:

  - Support prog-based attach/detach and link API
  - Dependency directives (can also be combined):
    - BPF_F_{BEFORE,AFTER} with relative_{fd,id} which can be {prog,link,none}
      - BPF_F_ID flag as {fd,id} toggle; the rationale for id is so that user
        space application does not need CAP_SYS_ADMIN to retrieve foreign fds
        via bpf_*_get_fd_by_id()
      - BPF_F_LINK flag as {prog,link} toggle
      - If relative_{fd,id} is none, then BPF_F_BEFORE will just prepend, and
        BPF_F_AFTER will just append for attaching
      - Enforced only at attach time
    - BPF_F_REPLACE with replace_bpf_fd which can be prog, links have their
      own infra for replacing their internal prog
    - If no flags are set, then it's default append behavior for attaching
  - Internal revision counter and optionally being able to pass expected_revision
  - User space application can query current state with revision, and pass it
    along for attachment to assert current state before doing updates
  - Query also gets extension for link_ids array and link_attach_flags:
    - prog_ids are always filled with program IDs
    - link_ids are filled with link IDs when link was used, otherwise 0
    - {prog,link}_attach_flags for holding {prog,link}-specific flags
  - Must be easy to integrate/reuse for in-kernel users

The uapi-side changes needed for supporting bpf_mprog are rather minimal,
consisting of the additions of the attachment flags, revision counter, and
expanding existing union with relative_{fd,id} member.

The bpf_mprog framework consists of an bpf_mprog_entry object which holds
an array of bpf_mprog_fp (fast-path structure). The bpf_mprog_cp (control-path
structure) is part of bpf_mprog_bundle. Both have been separated, so that
fast-path gets efficient packing of bpf_prog pointers for maximum cache
efficiency. Also, array has been chosen instead of linked list or other
structures to remove unnecessary indirections for a fast point-to-entry in
tc for BPF.

The bpf_mprog_entry comes as a pair via bpf_mprog_bundle so that in case of
updates the peer bpf_mprog_entry is populated and then just swapped which
avoids additional allocations that could otherwise fail, for example, in
detach case. bpf_mprog_{fp,cp} arrays are currently static, but they could
be converted to dynamic allocation if necessary at a point in future.
Locking is deferred to the in-kernel user of bpf_mprog, for example, in case
of tcx which uses this API in the next patch, it piggybacks on rtnl.

An extensive test suite for checking all aspects of this API for prog-based
attach/detach and link API comes as BPF selftests in this series.

Kudos also to Andrii Nakryiko for API discussions wrt Meta's BPF management.

[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Heavily reworks and resprites first aid analyzers. (#6673)

Original PR: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/76533
-----

## About The Pull Request

Heavily reworks and resprites first aid analyzers. They now display if
they're happy, sad, angry, or warning you! Also a 'pricking' animation.

First aid analyzers are now found in all basic and specialized medkits.
Toxin medkits get a new* disease analyzer. Miners get a miner-colored
one in their box.

Scanning yourself with a first aid analyzer will 'create a holo-image
with treatment instructions next to your wounds', doubling the speed of
treatment of scanned wounds!

Health analyzers now have a scanning sound, courtesy of CM.

Refactored some wound code to make treatment duration changes and
changes in the description of wounds easier.

Fixed a dummy parent feature of the health analyzer (Verbose mode)
showing up, uselessly, on the disease and first aid subtypes.

Surgical processors and slime scanners have recieved a similar resprite.
## Why It's Good For The Game

> Heavily reworks and resprites first aid analyzers. They now display if
they're happy, sad, angry, or warning you! Also a 'pricking' animation.

These things have long, long needed some sprite love. Displaying emotion
will make them have a lot more 'weight' to them, same with the prick.
The old, shitty spectrometer sprites have gone directly into the
dumpster.

> First aid analyzers are now found in all basic and specialized
medkits. Toxin medkits get a new* disease analyzer. Miners get a
miner-colored one in their box.

They have also needed some gameplay love! Placing them in these kits is
not going to be a massive game-changer when they were already easily
found around the station in emergency medkits, but it will fill up that
awkward empty slot.

> Scanning yourself with a first aid analyzer will 'create a holo-image
with treatment instructions next to your wounds', doubling the speed of
treatment of scanned wounds!

The biggest gameplay-impacting change in this PR, I *sincerely* believe
this is the perfect solution to first aid analyzers being completely
redundant with eyesight. This lets you/someone else scan your wounds to
speed up treatment, with a neat in-character reason for it -
'holo-images' appearing on your body, like penlights.

This will speed up wound treatment, but I believe that is for the best,
as currently treating wounds is so slow that half the time it's not
worth it (or more accurately, it doesn't feel worth it in comparison to
the effort you're putting in) and you're better off shrugging off minor
wounds. It will do so in a way that requires a modicum of effort, so
it's not just a flat buff across the land.

> Health analyzers and gene scanners now have a scanning sound, courtesy
of CM.

It's a neat sound that will make medbay feel more alive. First aid
analyzers get a beeboop instead.

> Surgical processors and slime scanners have recieved a similar
resprite.

Cassandra support for chat history using CassIO library (#6771)

### Overview

This PR aims at building on #4378, expanding the capabilities and
building on top of the `cassIO` library to interface with the database
(as opposed to using the core drivers directly).

Usage of `cassIO` (a library abstracting Cassandra access for
ML/GenAI-specific purposes) is already established since #6426 was
merged, so no new dependencies are introduced.

In the same spirit, we try to uniform the interface for using Cassandra
instances throughout LangChain: all our appreciation of the work by
@jj701 notwithstanding, who paved the way for this incremental work
(thank you!), we identified a few reasons for changing the way a
`CassandraChatMessageHistory` is instantiated. Advocating a syntax
change is something we don't take lighthearted way, so we add some
explanations about this below.

Additionally, this PR expands on integration testing, enables use of
Cassandra's native Time-to-Live (TTL) features and improves the phrasing
around the notebook example and the short "integrations" documentation
paragraph.

We would kindly request @hwchase to review (since this is an elaboration
and proposed improvement of #4378 who had the same reviewer).

### About the __init__ breaking changes

There are
[many](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/python-driver/3.28/api/cassandra/cluster/)
options when creating the `Cluster` object, and new ones might be added
at any time. Choosing some of them and exposing them as `__init__`
parameters `CassandraChatMessageHistory` will prove to be insufficient
for at least some users.

On the other hand, working through `kwargs` or adding a long, long list
of arguments to `__init__` is not a desirable option either. For this
reason, (as done in #6426), we propose that whoever instantiates the
Chat Message History class provide a Cassandra `Session` object, ready
to use. This also enables easier injection of mocks and usage of
Cassandra-compatible connections (such as those to the cloud database
DataStax Astra DB, obtained with a different set of init parameters than
`contact_points` and `port`).

We feel that a breaking change might still be acceptable since LangChain
is at `0.*`. However, while maintaining that the approach we propose
will be more flexible in the future, room could be made for a
"compatibility layer" that respects the current init method. Honestly,
we would to that only if there are strong reasons for it, as that would
entail an additional maintenance burden.

### Other changes

We propose to remove the keyspace creation from the class code for two
reasons: first, production Cassandra instances often employ RBAC so that
the database user reading/writing from tables does not necessarily (and
generally shouldn't) have permission to create keyspaces, and second
that programmatic keyspace creation is not a best practice (it should be
done more or less manually, with extra care about schema mismatched
among nodes, etc). Removing this (usually unnecessary) operation from
the `__init__` path would also improve initialization performance
(shorter time).

We suggest, likewise, to remove the `__del__` method (which would close
the database connection), for the following reason: it is the
recommended best practice to create a single Cassandra `Session` object
throughout an application (it is a resource-heavy object capable to
handle concurrency internally), so in case Cassandra is used in other
ways by the app there is the risk of truncating the connection for all
usages when the history instance is destroyed. Moreover, the `Session`
object, in typical applications, is best left to garbage-collect itself
automatically.

As mentioned above, we defer the actual database I/O to the `cassIO`
library, which is designed to encode practices optimized for LLM
applications (among other) without the need to expose LangChain
developers to the internals of CQL (Cassandra Query Language). CassIO is
already employed by the LangChain's Vector Store support for Cassandra.

We added a few more connection options in the companion notebook example
(most notably, Astra DB) to encourage usage by anyone who cannot run
their own Cassandra cluster.

We surface the `ttl_seconds` option for automatic handling of an
expiration time to chat history messages, a likely useful feature given
that very old messages generally may lose their importance.

We elaborated a bit more on the integration testing (Time-to-live,
separation of "session ids", ...).

### Remarks from linter & co.

We reinstated `cassio` as a dependency both in the "optional" group and
in the "integration testing" group of `pyproject.toml`. This might not
be the right thing do to, in which case the author of this PR offer his
apologies (lack of confidence with Poetry - happy to be pointed in the
right direction, though!).

During linter tests, we were hit by some errors which appear unrelated
to the code in the PR. We left them here and report on them here for
awareness:

```
langchain/vectorstores/mongodb_atlas.py:137: error: Argument 1 to "insert_many" of "Collection" has incompatible type "List[Dict[str, Sequence[object]]]"; expected "Iterable[Union[MongoDBDocumentType, RawBSONDocument]]"  [arg-type]
langchain/vectorstores/mongodb_atlas.py:186: error: Argument 1 to "aggregate" of "Collection" has incompatible type "List[object]"; expected "Sequence[Mapping[str, Any]]"  [arg-type]

langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:16: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:19: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:20: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:22: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:23: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
```

In the same spirit, we observe that to even get `import langchain` run,
it seems that a `pip install bs4` is missing from the minimal package
installation path.

Thank you!

Fixes some inconsistencies with the chaplain revolver and gets rid of a weird ammo define (#76237)

## About The Pull Request

Firstly, I gave the revolver a new sprite. I mean, this isn't so much of
an improvement as it is a reference I wanted to go with, so if people go
'no not a new sprite' I don't mind reverting.

What's the reference? Check the new name I added as a potential name
roll.

![lucky
38](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/40847847/e11874be-1416-4e21-bda9-4881d49cad1b)

Secondly; I applied to the gun itself revenant bane, the ability to
clear runes, and proper magic immunity as a full null rod would enable.
This last bit was a deliberate design choice, but the divine bow has
full magic protection, so I think this is now more of a consistency
consideration compared to the divine bow.

Thirdly, the revolver is a .38 revolver, HOWEVER, it uses a damage
multiplier to bring it back to the damage it did originally. It also
cannot be reloaded without the prayer action. No cheating. Effectively,
this is the same mechanically as it was before.

It rarely does a funny crit fanfare. This does nothing mechanically, I
just thought it was a funny nod to the sprite's reference (and I guess
another game that the crit fanfare is based on). Borrowed parts of the
code and sprite from this April Fool's pr by Wallemations >
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/74425

## Why It's Good For The Game

I think this might have been a little forgotten since implementation now
that we have another projectile weapon for the chaplain. So I'm brushing
it up a bit.

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: Makes the chaplain's revolver consistent with its immediate
sibling, the Divine Bow, by giving it similar statistics.
code: Makes the chaplain revolver a .38 but prevents it from being
loaded without using the special prayer action. Also applies a damage
multiplier to keep it at the original 18 force. Mechanically, no
different.
sprite: Gives the chaplain revolver a new sprite.
code: Removes an unnecessary admin log when removing runes.

fixed fucking typo that broke a rule

Downloads @ drive.online-fix.me are broken because the buttons API entry and download buttons are invisible despite forced stylesheet. Will attempt to fix this in the next update.  It's no big loss because those downloads require giving access to one's own Google Drive account which is an idiotic thing to do given the hostility of the person who runs online-fix.me.
The asshole that runs Devuploads has broken downloads again as has the asshole who runs DropGalaxy.  Both file hosts appear to be using the same anti-adblock technique, but getting past it hasn't worked so far because uBlock is apparently ignoring the rules I have tried to bypass it.  I may have to remove rules or make exceptions to let more ad crap through for Devuploads and DropGalaxy to work.
hurry.stream embedded videos still do not play, but it looks like it may be a problem with hurry.stream as it also has CORS blocking the m3u8 file requests on Chromium-based browsers and Firefox.  Streaming a video from hurry.stream has only ever worked for me on Android, but that was without any adblocking so have not yet tested with my adblocking rules on Android.
https://freestreams-live1.tv/nflnetwork5/ is still broken.  It appears the script which creates the embedded video iframe is being blocked at least in part.  freestreams-live1.tv works with other channels/streams though.

Plasma objects no longer violently explode when ignited (#76492)

## About The Pull Request
This is one of those "can I get away with making a change I want" PRs.

I actually didn't know this had been changed before as it's not exactly
something I mess with often, but I really think it sucks. Plasma stuff
is supposed to ignite and cause fires, not explode (unless in a TTV). I
noticed this when I was poking around and found out that apparently
Disco Inferno just explodes now instead of setting on fire which also
sucks.

I figure there's a few fixes for this problem:

1) Nerf how hard plasma stuff explodes. This is an option, but I kind of
dislike that it does it at all more than anything. The biggest issue is
that just the regular statues explode with 20 LIGHT, which is pretty
fucking massive and basically just delimbs everyone around. I'd have to
nerf it HARD for it to get anywhere near what I think is acceptable.
2) Make a snowflake version of the statue that just ignites on hit with
a torch. I also don't like this because it'll make people think the
regular statues don't explode.
3) This option, which I think is cleaner and just makes sense compared
to the others.

I don't know if @vincentiusvin still codes, but as far as I can tell
this was their doing, so it's only fair they get to speak up.

Fixes #71894

## Why It's Good For The Game
I don't like it, I think it goes against what we're used to for plasma
stuff (that it starts fires, not makes explosions) and it makes one of
my favorite shuttles boring and stupid. That being said, I'm honestly
not going to fight for this too hard if a lot of people like it, but I
am - as always - open to alternatives.

## Changelog
:cl: Vekter
del: Plasma objects (statues, toilets, etc.) no longer explode when
ignited. They just release plasma like everything else plasma. (This
doesn't impact injecting plasma into cells or dipping cigars in plasma,
those still explode.)

bevy_audio: ECS-based API redesign (#8424)

# Objective

Improve the `bevy_audio` API to make it more user-friendly and
ECS-idiomatic. This PR is a first-pass at addressing some of the most
obvious (to me) problems. In the interest of keeping the scope small,
further improvements can be done in future PRs.

The current `bevy_audio` API is very clunky to work with, due to how it
(ab)uses bevy assets to represent audio sinks.

The user needs to write a lot of boilerplate (accessing
`Res<Assets<AudioSink>>`) and deal with a lot of cognitive overhead
(worry about strong vs. weak handles, etc.) in order to control audio
playback.

Audio playback is initiated via a centralized `Audio` resource, which
makes it difficult to keep track of many different sounds playing in a
typical game.

Further, everything carries a generic type parameter for the sound
source type, making it difficult to mix custom sound sources (such as
procedurally generated audio or unofficial formats) with regular audio
assets.

Let's fix these issues.

## Solution

Refactor `bevy_audio` to a more idiomatic ECS API. Remove the `Audio`
resource. Do everything via entities and components instead.

Audio playback data is now stored in components:
- `PlaybackSettings`, `SpatialSettings`, `Handle<AudioSource>` are now
components. The user inserts them to tell Bevy to play a sound and
configure the initial playback parameters.
- `AudioSink`, `SpatialAudioSink` are now components instead of special
magical "asset" types. They are inserted by Bevy when it actually begins
playing the sound, and can be queried for by the user in order to
control the sound during playback.

Bundles: `AudioBundle` and `SpatialAudioBundle` are available to make it
easy for users to play sounds. Spawn an entity with one of these bundles
(or insert them to a complex entity alongside other stuff) to play a
sound.

Each entity represents a sound to be played.

There is also a new "auto-despawn" feature (activated using
`PlaybackSettings`), which, if enabled, tells Bevy to despawn entities
when the sink playback finishes. This allows for "fire-and-forget" sound
playback. Users can simply
spawn entities whenever they want to play sounds and not have to worry
about leaking memory.

## Unsolved Questions

I think the current design is *fine*. I'd be happy for it to be merged.
It has some possibly-surprising usability pitfalls, but I think it is
still much better than the old `bevy_audio`. Here are some discussion
questions for things that we could further improve. I'm undecided on
these questions, which is why I didn't implement them. We should decide
which of these should be addressed in this PR, and what should be left
for future PRs. Or if they should be addressed at all.

### What happens when sounds start playing?

Currently, the audio sink components are inserted and the bundle
components are kept. Should Bevy remove the bundle components? Something
else?

The current design allows an entity to be reused for playing the same
sound with the same parameters repeatedly. This is a niche use case I'd
like to be supported, but if we have to give it up for a simpler design,
I'd be fine with that.

### What happens if users remove any of the components themselves?

As described above, currently, entities can be reused. Removing the
audio sink causes it to be "detached" (I kept the old `Drop` impl), so
the sound keeps playing. However, if the audio bundle components are not
removed, Bevy will detect this entity as a "queued" sound entity again
(has the bundle compoenents, without a sink component), just like before
playing the sound the first time, and start playing the sound again.

This behavior might be surprising? Should we do something different?

### Should mutations to `PlaybackSettings` be applied to the audio sink?

We currently do not do that. `PlaybackSettings` is just for the initial
settings when the sound starts playing. This is clearly documented.

Do we want to keep this behavior, or do we want to allow users to use
`PlaybackSettings` instead of `AudioSink`/`SpatialAudioSink` to control
sounds during playback too?

I think I prefer for them to be kept separate. It is not a bad mental
model once you understand it, and it is documented.

### Should `AudioSink` and `SpatialAudioSink` be unified into a single
component type?

They provide a similar API (via the `AudioSinkPlayback` trait) and it
might be annoying for users to have to deal with both of them. The
unification could be done using an enum that is matched on internally by
the methods. Spatial audio has extra features, so this might make it
harder to access. I think we shouldn't.

### Automatic synchronization of spatial sound properties from
Transforms?

Should Bevy automatically apply changes to Transforms to spatial audio
entities? How do we distinguish between listener and emitter? Which one
does the transform represent? Where should the other one come from?

Alternatively, leave this problem for now, and address it in a future
PR. Or do nothing, and let users deal with it, as shown in the
`spatial_audio_2d` and `spatial_audio_3d` examples.

---

## Changelog

Added:
- `AudioBundle`/`SpatialAudioBundle`, add them to entities to play
sounds.

Removed:
 - The `Audio` resource.
 - `AudioOutput` is no longer `pub`.

Changed:
 - `AudioSink`, `SpatialAudioSink` are now components instead of assets.

## Migration Guide

// TODO: write a more detailed migration guide, after the "unsolved
questions" are answered and this PR is finalized.

Before:

```rust

/// Need to store handles somewhere
#[derive(Resource)]
struct MyMusic {
    sink: Handle<AudioSink>,
}

fn play_music(
    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
    audio: Res<Audio>,
    audio_sinks: Res<Assets<AudioSink>>,
    mut commands: Commands,
) {
    let weak_handle = audio.play_with_settings(
        asset_server.load("music.ogg"),
        PlaybackSettings::LOOP.with_volume(0.5),
    );
    // upgrade to strong handle and store it
    commands.insert_resource(MyMusic {
        sink: audio_sinks.get_handle(weak_handle),
    });
}

fn toggle_pause_music(
    audio_sinks: Res<Assets<AudioSink>>,
    mymusic: Option<Res<MyMusic>>,
) {
    if let Some(mymusic) = &mymusic {
        if let Some(sink) = audio_sinks.get(&mymusic.sink) {
            sink.toggle();
        }
    }
}
```

Now:

```rust
/// Marker component for our music entity
#[derive(Component)]
struct MyMusic;

fn play_music(
    mut commands: Commands,
    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
) {
    commands.spawn((
        AudioBundle::from_audio_source(asset_server.load("music.ogg"))
            .with_settings(PlaybackSettings::LOOP.with_volume(0.5)),
        MyMusic,
    ));
}

fn toggle_pause_music(
    // `AudioSink` will be inserted by Bevy when the audio starts playing
    query_music: Query<&AudioSink, With<MyMusic>>,
) {
    if let Ok(sink) = query.get_single() {
        sink.toggle();
    }
}
```

add alpaca gpt4 dataset (#2610)

The inputs can be quite a lot of different versions of `no input`,
therefore don't use the `input` column for that.
In some cases the text in `input` is already in the instruction, in
these cases, we also don't use the `input` column.

I am not quite sure how to concatenate the `instruction` and the `input`
column. In most cases it seems fine to just replace last appearance of
`.`, `!` or `?` with a colon, e.g.:
Instruction: `Identify the odd one out.`
Input: `Twitter, Instagram, Telegram`
or 
Instruction: `How dense is a given material?`
Input: `Steel`

But we also have some questions like:
Instruction: `Given the following synopsis, what is the moral lesson of
this story?`
Input: `Once upon a time, there was a poor young boy who wanted some
candy. He begged his father for money to buy it, but his father said no
and ordered him to go to bed. As he was going to bed, the boy saw a
five-dollar bill on the counter, which he took and bought the candy.`

Where this might not be the best case. Either way, I think the this one
token will not make significant difference the model and therefore I
just concatenate instruction and input with a space.

Larva Queue Late Joiner Nerf (#3803)

# About the pull request

This PR makes it so players who haven't played yet have their join time
recorded, and that is used for their initial sorting value rather than
0. This means late joiners will be at the back of the line as if they
had just died.

This PR also fixes an oversight where ghosting as a facehugger would
count as death. Even though they really shouldn't be ghosting when
alive, they still shouldn't be penalized as far as the queue is
concerned.

# Explain why it's good for the game

Its not; its a bad experience for everyone that hasn't even gotten one
life in the round. However it seems I'm in the minority thinking that a
xeno shouldn't squander their first life and that death shouldn't bear
more consequences.

Add logic grid puzzle eval (#830)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
`logic-grid`

### Eval description

The model is prompted with a logic grid word problem with a list of
hints, categories, and values for the category. The model is then asked
to provide a solution, showing reasoning, in a set of Python tuples that
show the matched category values.

<details>
  <summary>See human-friendly example prompt</summary>

```
Using the hints and information provided, solve the following logic grid puzzle.
Show your reasoning concisely, but step-by-step, to arrive at your final answer.
Remember, since this is a grid-based puzzle, each option in every category will be used exactly once.
Since there are 4 values per category, and 3 categories, your final answer will include 4 tuples each of length 3.
 Puzzle Scenario:
A number of new space probes were launched this year. Using only the clues that follow, match each probe to the month it launched and its eventual destination.

Category Options:
  Probes: "Nalini", "Hikaru", "Sarika", and "Sven"
  Destinations: "Ganymede", "Titan", "Enceladus", and "Phobos"
  Months: "January", "February", "March", and "April"

Hints:
  1: The Hikaru launched 2 months before the Nalini.
  2: The probe going to Phobos launched sometime after the Hikaru.
  3: The Sven launched 2 months before the mission going to Ganymede.
  4: Of the probe that launched in April and the mission going to Titan, one is the Sarika and the other is the Nalini.

In your response, format your final answer for each set of linked category values as a python tuple of strings in this order:
("Enceladus", [value from months], [value from probes])
("Ganymede", [value from months], [value from probes])
("Phobos", [value from months], [value from probes])
("Titan", [value from months], [value from probes])
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>See expected/ideal answer</summary>

```
("Enceladus", "January", "Hikaru")
("Ganymede", "April", "Sarika")
("Phobos", "February", "Sven")
("Titan", "March", "Nalini")
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>See failure case from GPT-4 (at least from the web UI - I don't
have API access to GPT-4)</summary>

```
Step 1: From Hint 3, we know that Hikaru launched 2 months before Nalini. Since the latest month available is April, this means that Nalini cannot have launched in April because there wouldn't be a 2-month gap for Hikaru. So, Nalini must be the probe going to Titan (from Hint 4), and Sarika must be the probe that launched in April.

Step 2: Since Nalini is going to Titan, from Hint 4, it must have launched in February to allow Hikaru to launch in December (2 months before). However, December is not an option, so Hikaru must have launched in January (the earliest month possible) and Nalini in March.

Step 3: The Sven launched 2 months before the mission going to Ganymede (Hint 2). Since Sven cannot be launched in January (as Hikaru is launched in January), it must have launched in February. That means the mission to Ganymede must be in April.

Step 4: The only remaining month is March, and the only remaining probe is Nalini. So Nalini was launched in March.

Step 5: The probe going to Phobos launched sometime after Hikaru (Hint 1). Since Hikaru launched in January, the only remaining option for Phobos is Sarika, which launched in April.

Step 6: The only remaining destination is Enceladus, and the only remaining probe is Hikaru, so Hikaru is going to Enceladus.

The final answer is:
("Enceladus", "January", "Hikaru")
("Ganymede", "April", "Sven")
("Phobos", "April", "Sarika")
("Titan", "March", "Nalini")
```
</details>

### What makes this a useful eval?

This set of evals relies on a lot of *context-ramping* (as I call it)
for LLMs to get right - relying on chain-of-thought style logic to
'ramp' into the most likely next-deduction for a multi-parameter logical
problem.
These prompts are written as word problems and don't rely on any ASCII
or markdown type of table to express the puzzle (though `gpt-3.5-turbo`
appears to use markdown tables in it's chain of thought).

This ramping gets expensive and doesn't scale well with the increase of
category or values-per-category parameters, and is something that LLMs
might benefit from avoiding (either by requiring less of a context-ramp
to get to the meat of an answer, or by the surrounding
infrastructure/problem agent that tries to use a cheaper ensemble for
most of the context ramping, or other strategies).

The reasoning skills required for this kind of <b>constraint
satisfaction</b> expressed in natural language word prompts can, in
theory, generalize to solving constraints expressed in less structured
formats in the wild.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [X] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [X] <span title="A GPT-4 failure case from the eval set is included
above.">Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either
GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.</span>
- [X] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [X] **<span title="15 examples per grid size are included, for 6
different grid sizes, make a total of 90 included examples.">Include at
least 15 high quality examples.</span>**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This eval contains varied prompts and grid sizes, 15 examples per grid
size, for a total of 90 procedurally generated puzzles.
~This PR also implements (disabled by default) multiline answers and
punctuation whitelisting behavior in `FuzzyMatch`, which was required
due to the structural nature of the logic grid answers and the behavior
of `utils.normalize(...)` which (prior to this PR) did not provide any
functionality to interpret answers that span across newline characters
`\n` or preserve punctuation where it may be useful (in this case, the
model is prompted for the resultant grid associations in python tuple
format, so the punctuation in `(",)` is configured to be preserved for
these evals).
The new functionality is, again, disabled by default, such that existing
evals are not affected.~

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [X] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [X] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [X] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [X] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [X] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [X] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [X] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [X] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

[Eval] English-Russian homonym context resolution (GPT-3.5: 0.42) (#1064)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, pelase note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
English-Russian homonym context resolution

### Eval description

Cross-lingual English-Russian eval to resolve ambiguity with homonyms
present.

### What makes this a useful eval?

[Insert why this eval is worth including and any additional context]
Cross-lingual homonyms are hard to resolve: they add context ambiguity,
which needs to be resolved via reasoning.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
> german-part-of-speech

### Eval description

> For a given German word, the model is asked to list all possible parts
of speech (multiple choice). The model is also asked to think about the
word as an inflection of another word. The models output is tested
against annotations extracted from de.wiktionary.org. This is a follow
up to #1039

### What makes this a useful eval?

> Part of speech analysis is a basic task in language / grammar classes.
While it is usually done in the context of a sentence, coming up with
possible uses in lack of a sentence requires a certain amount of
creativity and language understanding, or very good recall of
information that is usually sparse outside of dictionaries. The task in
this eval could be seen as a combination of part of speech analysis and
an easy-to-evaluate form of the question "How could x be used in a
sentence".

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> To build the dataset, all 1.000.000+ entries of the German wiktionary
were parsed. Excluded from this list were all phrases, abbreviations,
symbols, names, toponyms and any words with at least one possible part
of speech not fitting the categories given in the prompt. Also I had to
exclude some entries where the part of speech could not be determined
automatically from the wikitext.
> From this set, words were sampled so that each combination of the
parts of speech existing in the dataset would be equally likely in the
tests. This way the model is tested to respond with all possible uses of
a word and not just the most common ones. > For combinations that fit a
lot of words, the uniform sampling led to a bias towards rarely used
words.
> The labels of each word were taken from the corresponding page at
de.wiktionary.org/wiki/{word}. The information taken from each page was:
the word, the part of speech this word can have in German and whether
the word is an abbreviation or not.
> This means only factual data was taken and is therefore in the public
domain.

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`

refactor(back): hack to bypass validation on map creation DTOs

I hate doing this, but doing the explicitly creation DTOs for this is so difficult,
and it's going to be changing so soon anyway. I don't wanna spend half an hour refactoring
class-validator shit that we're going to remove before we even deploy!

ADDED CLEAR

1. Wrote a js function clearCanvasthat clears shaded divs by removing classes.
2. Added that class to resizeGridNumbers so the canvas is cleared everytime the user updates the canvas.
3. Added a button which calls the clearCanvas separately so users have an option to clear canvas without having to changa canvas size.
4. I want more features but https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AcbHiJtbcM (aka idk the  stuff I need to make what I make yet).

thanks for sticking around until this commit message, fren. It means a lot. a real lot.

[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] New planetary exclusive random event/unfavorable situation, Chasmic Earthquake (#6193)

Original PR: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/75864
-----
## About The Pull Request


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/28870487/2451bc69-db1e-420d-9a18-2f899ca65427

This introduces a new unfavorable situation (non-antagonist random
events that dynamic triggers under certain circumstances), restricted to
planetary maps (Icebox). An earthquake occurs, felt by everyone on the
map, forming a fault that tears the a hole somewhere on the station.

The fault zone is indicated by shaking tiles, which gives a chance
(about 30 seconds) for you to move your machinery/property/crewmembers
out of the way. If you're on those tiles when the fault forms, get ready
to take a nasty fall.

Anything caught in the fault zone as it collapses inward will be
destroyed, violently, _before_ being dropped down into the z-level
below.


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/28870487/56916c9f-c8da-4ffb-9d8b-7e940e92bbc2)

These can also happen as a random event, however their rarity is on-par
with that of a meteor storm.

This also adds a helper for finding a midpoint turf between two provided
turfs, thanks to ZephyrTFA.

This idea basically possessed me over the course of a few days, and I
found myself unable to work on anything else until I had it complete.
I'm glad its done.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Gives Icebox its own big "environmental disaster" event. I'm hoping it
isn't received as being too destructive, but mind that this is meant to
be an equal to the dreaded meteor storm.

Also makes it so that unfavorable events aren't a coinflip between a
portal storm/rod on planetary maps.
## Changelog
:cl: Rhials
add: Chasmic Earthquake random event, exclusive to Icebox. Tears a huge
chasm in the hull of the station. Watch out for shaking tiles!
sound: Adds sounds for distant rumbling, metal creaking, and rubble
shaking.
imageadd: Achievement icon for getting sucked up in an earthquake chasm.

Plasma objects no longer violently explode when ignited [MDB IGNORE] (#22216)

* Plasma objects no longer violently explode when ignited (#76492)

## About The Pull Request
This is one of those "can I get away with making a change I want" PRs.

I actually didn't know this had been changed before as it's not exactly
something I mess with often, but I really think it sucks. Plasma stuff
is supposed to ignite and cause fires, not explode (unless in a TTV). I
noticed this when I was poking around and found out that apparently
Disco Inferno just explodes now instead of setting on fire which also
sucks.

I figure there's a few fixes for this problem:

1) Nerf how hard plasma stuff explodes. This is an option, but I kind of
dislike that it does it at all more than anything. The biggest issue is
that just the regular statues explode with 20 LIGHT, which is pretty
fucking massive and basically just delimbs everyone around. I'd have to
nerf it HARD for it to get anywhere near what I think is acceptable.
2) Make a snowflake version of the statue that just ignites on hit with
a torch. I also don't like this because it'll make people think the
regular statues don't explode.
3) This option, which I think is cleaner and just makes sense compared
to the others.

I don't know if @ vincentiusvin still codes, but as far as I can tell
this was their doing, so it's only fair they get to speak up.

Fixes #71894

## Why It's Good For The Game
I don't like it, I think it goes against what we're used to for plasma
stuff (that it starts fires, not makes explosions) and it makes one of
my favorite shuttles boring and stupid. That being said, I'm honestly
not going to fight for this too hard if a lot of people like it, but I
am - as always - open to alternatives.

## Changelog
:cl: Vekter
del: Plasma objects (statues, toilets, etc.) no longer explode when
ignited. They just release plasma like everything else plasma. (This
doesn't impact injecting plasma into cells or dipping cigars in plasma,
those still explode.)

Rat RP expansion [MDB IGNORE] (#22204)

* Rat RP expansion (#76455)

## About The Pull Request

This fixes a vile and long-standing bug where putting a mouse inside
your hat would not allow the mouse to control your movements, as it
would pop out of the hat whenever it tried to move.
Additionally as a feature this allows a mouse sitting on your head to
convey complicated instructions such as "scream" or "do a flip", via
emoting. Through drift compatibility, the rat's living mech will also
perform this action.

I could have made this into a component but there's no fucking way any
other item is going to have this behaviour, so I didn't.

## Why It's Good For The Game

This feature was already in the game but broken and I want it not to be
broken.
The mouse should be able to control your entire life.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Placing a mouse inside your chef hat will once more allow it to
pilot you around.
add: A player-controlled mouse inside your chef hat can compel you to
perform complex actions, such as flipping and spinning. You will obey
because the mouse knows better than you do.

ESM (Mostly there!)

Not sure why I did this, especially all at once, but I converted as much of the library as I could over to ESM, as I would like to both see how and help out with how it works.

I'm working on an NBT editor project that I might like to utilize Ace with, and I thought having first-class TypeScript and ESM support would be something great to have here! Not sure if someone else has already done this, and this was all redundant, but I'm trying it out anyways. It's good for my own practice/skills/understanding. It's a bonus if the main project will be able to use these changes! That would be the ideal situation.

Ace has been a nice editor, I remember it back from when I was in High School AP CSP. Code.org used Ace, and I had always wondered how editing code in the browser worked, because you were writing code for the browser, in the browser. That was always very interesting to me. I wonder if that's what sparked the idea for stedit.app? :O

Being able to have tree-shaking, dynamic imports for language definitions, and built-in internal library checking would be a great thing for this project, it has been exceptionally awesome for my own projects, I can imagine how much more worthwhile it would be for bigger projects like these, where it really can shine.

I didn't work on any of the Test files yet, I just renamed them from `_test.js` to `.test.js` so I could distinguish them apart from the main source files.

VS Code refactoring was absolutely outstanding for this, it works great! You do have to go back and fix some of it's formatting changes though, as I didn't want to include other small changes in the commit that weren't specifically for ESM setup, and or ES6 class upgrades, those were the only two things for this work today.

This did take all way, probably about 4 separate sessions, had to be at least 8 hours? No way that's right, but it was probably more than that even. Why is this fun? I don't know, but I'm rolling with it!

[MIRROR] [MDB IGNORE] Bilingual can now choose their language (#6676)

Original PR: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/76609
-----
## About The Pull Request

This was one of the tradeoffs for removing other, more consistent
sources of languages, and was requested by Melbert among many others.
This does go against my wanted goal of decreasing the risk of
eavesdropping by other players through just magically knowing a
language, but it is an expensive quirk and it is in their medical
records, which makes it better than language encryption keys or silicon
just innately knowing them.

This also limits Bilingual to only roundstart languages (+Uncommon),
rather than being randomly selected from a list (that had very useless
ones like monkey, podpeople, and beachbum). This is mostly just for
modularity, I didn't want to make it look terrible code-wise and thought
this may be the optimal way to handle it.

This is also me going back on
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/71773 - which I had closed
myself.

closes: #6144

## Why It's Good For The Game

If we're gonna keep the Bilingual quirk, it might as well be something
players can choose the language of, it's their character and they should
be allowed to decide how their character is, and it is my fault that
this stupid compromise of "getting a random language" was made in the
first place. It never should've happened.
It now actually limits it to roundstart-only languages, so there's no
way you can spy on people who prepare in advance through becoming
podpeople, or monkeys, etc.

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: Bilingual quirk now lets you choose your language between ones
given to roundstart species.
balance: Foreigner and Bilingual are now mutually exclusive languages.
del: Trilingual has been removed in favor of Bilingual.

Update README.md

The project focuses on building a mental health tracker. You will try to get an idea of the mental
state of your user (in the least intrusive ways), find out if they are suffering and then suggest
measures they can take to get out of their present condition.
A user answers some questions and based on the answers that they provide, you will suggest tasks
to them and maintain a record of their mental state for displaying on a dashboard. Mental disorders
are widespread in countries all over the world. Nevertheless, there is a global shortage in human
resources delivering mental health services.
Leaving people with mental disorders untreated may increase suicide attempts and mortality. To
address this matter of limited resources, conversational agents have gained momentum in the last
years. In this work, we introduce a mobile application with integrated Chabot that implements
methods from cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to support mentally ill people in regulating
emotions and dealing with thoughts and feelings.
Application asks the user on daily basis on events that occurred and on emotions. It determines
automatically the basic emotion of a user from the natural language input using natural language
processing and a lexicon-based approach. Depending on the emotion, an appropriate measurement
such as activities or mindfulness exercises is suggested by application.

Optimizes timer insertion by 80% (W QDEL_IN micro) (#76214)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

[Reduces timer insertion cost by
80%](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/c9e5b285ed74e60108fddd3f6b45d6d3995c92a8)

Timer name generation involved a LOT of string shit, some in ways where
the string only existed for a moment.
This costs a good bit of time, and can be reduced with only minimal
impacts on the end product, so let's do that. Includes a compile flag to
flip it back if we ever have trouble in future.

This is about 0.1s off init, since we do a lot of timer stuff then too

[Removes STOPPABLE flag from QDEL_IN, moves it to a bespoke
macro](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/e7a5d7f2a78fcf0dce4742ced258c9505411b202)

Its a waste most of the time, tho I would LOVE to analyze at compile
time to work out if we care
## Why It's Good For The Game

I like it when we don't spend all of our cpu time just setting the name
var on timers. that's good and not bad.
This saves time fucking everywhere. 15% off explosions, 0.1 seconds off
init, bunch of time off foam. it's just good.

Cherry picked out of #76104 since that was too cluttered (sannnnnn)

Adds border smoothing! (Look ma I'm upstreaming) (#76134)

## About The Pull Request

Ok so we currently have 1 (count em) border object that wants to smooth
with other border objects. That's the tram window.

It currently does this manually, via map edits, but that's kinda crappy
so lets be better.

This pr adds a new smoothing mode to handle border objects. 
Unlike other smoothing modes, it returns a bitfield of directions the
border object connects in.

I do this by memorizing a calculation of which dirs "connect" at init,
and reading out of a global list with border object direction, direction
between objects, and if it's a border object, the other object's dir.

I'm doing this primarily because it's become useful for wallening (a
spriter saw the tram thing and is doing the same thing to pod windows,
and I want to support that)

I do think it's potentially useful in other applications too tho, and I
like dehardcoding tram windows.

Also fun bonus (or maybe downside), it's nearly 0 cost because I pulled
the bitmask smoothing define into 2 subdefines, and am swapping the
handler one out to do what I want.
Oh also I got rid of a for loop in smoothing code, redundant and costs
time in list iteration

[Moves tram windows over to the new border object
smoothing](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/114873679c94d680788edee9665fa18dba8108c0)

Also replaces some typepath chicanery with a setDir override, for
redundancy in future
Oh and there's a update paths script too, to be nice

## Why It's Good For The Game

More visual possibility in future, fixes a hack we have currently, and
makes some spriters happy.

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: Dehardcodes some stuff with tram windows, they'll be easier to map
with now
refactor: Border objects can now smooth with each other. I'm sure
something cool will come of this

Enhanced file context generation in prompts

This commit ain't just about adding or removing a few lines of code. It's about giving a damn about the context. We've added a function to generate a directory structure, and we're using it to provide a more comprehensive context for the sidekick prompt. Now, not only do you get the relevant files, but you also get a nice little map of the directory structure. Ain't that something?

And let's not forget about the files. We've improved the way we handle them too. If there ain't no files, we don't just leave you hanging. We give you the directory structure and call it a day. But if there are files, oh boy, we give you the whole shebang. We read 'em, we count 'em, and we warn you if they're too damn big.

So, in summary, we've made the file context generation in prompts more informative and more useful. And if you don't appreciate that, well, I don't know what to tell you.

Create Problem

One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 ≤ w ≤ 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Loads Away Missions for Unit Testing (#76245)

## About The Pull Request

Hey there,

A pretty bad bug (#76226) got through, but it was fixed pretty quickly
in #76241 (cf92862daf339e97c76b52c91f31d49ba5113bd4). I realized that if
we were testing all the away missions, that this could theoretically get
caught and not happen again. Regardless, unit testing gateway missions
has been on my to-do list for a while now, and I finally got it nailed
down.

Basically, we just have a really small "station" map with the bare bones
(_teeny_ bit of fluff, maploading is going to take 30 seconds tops
anyways let me have my kicks) with a JSON map datum flag that causes it
to load all away missions in the codebase (which are all in one folder).
Just in case some admins were planning on invoking the proc on
`SSmapping`, I also decided to gate a `tgui_alert()` behind it because
you never can be too sure of what people think is funny these days (it
really does lock up your game for a second or so at a time).

I also alphabetized the maps.txt config because that was annoying me.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Things that break on production could(?) be caught in unit testing? I
don't know if the linked issue I mentioned above would have been caught
in retrospect, but it's likely to catch more than a few upcoming bugs
(like the UO45 atmospherics thing at the very top) and ensure that these
gateway missions, which tend to be the most neglected part of mapping,
stay bug-free.

This is also helpful in case someone makes a new away mission and wants
to see if stuff's broken. Helps out maptainers a bit because very, very
technically broken mapping will throw up runtimes. Neato.
## Changelog
Nothing that players should be concerned about.

Let me know if there's a better way to approach this, but I really think
that having a super-duper light map with the bare basics to load up
gateway missions and then all nine-ish gateway missions can sequentially
load during init. I can't think of a better way to do it aside from some
really ugly `#ifdef` shit. Also also, it has the added benefit of being
a map that will always load your away mission without touching a single
shred of config (and it's not likely to break if you follow sane
practices such as making your own areas)

Various spider fixes (#76528)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #76484
Then I noticed some weird stuff which slipped through the PR and poked
at that too.

- Spiderlings and Spiders once more have names ending in (###)
- Removed an unused property on Spiderlings.
- Rewrote the descriptions for a bunch of web-abilities and web-objects
to be clearer and have better capitalisation.
- Refactored the "Web Carcass" ability to not extend from "lay web" as
it didn't need to perform most of that behaviour.
- Also I renamed it and made the description give you a hint about why
you would want to instantly spawn a statue.
- The web effigy now despawns at the same rate as the ability cools down
so you're not dumping spider statues all over the place.
- I made spiderlings move at about the same speed as humans except if
they're on webs in which case they're still pretty fast.

To be honest I am not certain an instant statue spawning button is great
to begin with and I didn't even know it was added to the game but I am
not interested in messing much with the balance for now.

This made me look at spiderlings enough that I'm going to try and make a
new sprite for them that isn't awful.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Lets you differentiate individual spiders a little bit.
Makes usage of abilities clearer.

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: Guard spider web statues despawn as the ability comes back off
cooldown.
balance: Spiderlings now only move at light speed if they're on webs,
stay safe little guys.
fix: Spiders once again have random numbers after their names.

Disable zoom on mobile devices to avoid unescapeable map issue (#346)

This fixes https://github.com/josephfrazier/Reported-Web/issues/344 by
preventing zoom entirely, on mobile devices:

> From https://reportedcab.slack.com/archives/C9VNM3DL4/p1657204889174239?thread_ts=1656783831.210109&cid=C9VNM3DL4:

> >
> >
> > I don't think I've made any changes relating to pinching or the map in at least a year (if you're curious, you can see the list of changes here), so I'm not sure how to explain the difference in behavior you're seeing.

> > > (2) map view issue #1: The only ways to get out of map view are (1) click one of the buttons on the bottom, or (2) touch the grayed-out part of the underlying page. If neither of those is visible, you can't get out of map view. This means that if you pinch the map out (expand it), even accidentally, so that the margin around the map itself is no longer visible, there is no way to get out of map view, you have to reload the page (and re-upload your photo or maybe start the whole report over, I can't remember). (You can't pinch it back in if the entire window is full of map.)
> >
> >
> > I'm curious how you were previously able to pinch-zoom the map/page such that neither the buttons or the margin were visible. When I try (on Android), I can either pinch the map, which only zooms the map while leaving the rest of the page alone, or I can pinch the margin, which zooms the entire page, but the margin is still visible because I'm pinching it.
> > Perhaps things behave differently on iOS?
>
> > Actually the map zoom issue is: if you are zoomed out at all when you enter map view (which you often are, especially on an iPad, and you may not realize it), you’re screwed, because you can’t zoom in (in order to see the buttons or margins, the things you have to click in order to get out of map view) if the only things your fingers can touch are the map itself
>
> > ohhh, I see now, and I was able to reproduce that issue. I wonder if there's a way to detect the zoom level, and prompt the user to zoom back out all the way before they can open the map
> > (side note, I think we're using "zoom in" and "zoom out" with opposite meanings. To me "zooming in" makes the things on screen bigger, and "zooming out" makes them smaller)

> This PR now affects the following:
> 
> ### Fixed some issues regarding abilities (GUI)
> * Tooltip coloring for increasing levels
> * Experience gained from decreasing was 1 level lower than intended

> * Right side of the experience cost for abilities had the wrong start location
> * When increasing or decreasing ability levels all were shown as obtainable (until screen was re-opened)
> 
> ### Other
> * Removed bad omen application when you kill a knight (only occurred as a non-dragon)
> * Fixed some issue with water cauldron block (sea dragon gained no good mana condition from it)
> 
> ### Fixed a bug with the Claws and Teeth description
> * The harvest level text was not accurate (starting from gold? it was 1 level too high)
> 
> ### Fixed issues with harvesting
> * Modded ore support for drops when only using paws (most modded ores should already work but this fixes certain other instances, mostly MCreator related)
> * Config for bonusUnlockedAt is now respected
> * ServerConfig.baseHarvestLevel is now actually used
> * Minimum level for base and bonus level is now 0 (wood)
> * When the tool in the claw inventory breaks block-breaking will no longer desync
> * Block breaking speed is only applied if the dragon is effective against the block (e.g. cave dragon can mine pickaxe-blocks faster but not shovel-blocks)

Elite Four + Champion refights

This was an interesting thought exercise.

As you can see, this code adds a scaling function for when you reach the KEP post-game. These teams are very powerful and a strong test of the player's skills.

I did, however, remove the Legendary Pokemon from the first three's teams. They felt a little bit out there and kind of decrease the significance of the player's. Plus, we just went through hell adding conditional Hall of Fame respawns.

The Elite Four use refight text based on their LGPE appearances. It's honestly a little odd, so if it's too much, the FRLG conditional text could be used instead. I like the way Agatha's plays out, though...

Anyway, stupid hacky implementation done, please don't look at how I did the champion's trainer number.

Welding Fuel Tanks now log_bomber when hit by projectile (#75885)

## About The Pull Request

This was intended behavior, but I think a lot of bullshit over the years
sorta corrupted this proc's intention. Anyways, we just override the
whole ass proc for this one check, give a good return value (or at least
the same one that we were always giving) if our criteria is met, rather
than deal with the problems that parent was feeding us.


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/34697715/e2b39140-d365-43aa-8834-2740f9fa5036)

The specific issue here was that the parent of `bullet_act()` was
invoking `take_damage()` which prematurely invoked `boom()` which
invokes `qdel()`, meaning that the `QDELETED()` check would _always_
early return without fail every time.

Let's just do our own thing here.
## Why It's Good For The Game


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/34697715/ca8fdeba-9f5d-4bed-afba-88824d389cfb)

Intended behavior actually works.
## Changelog

Replaces the Reaper Scythe with the Vorpal Scythe (also the Morbid trait) (#75948)

adds the Vorpal Scythe, a special chaplain null rod variant, replacing
the Reaper Scythe, a not so special null rod variant.

When you choose the vorpal scythe, it comes as a shard that you implant
into your arm, similar to a cursed katana.

Once implanted, you can draw it at any time like an arm implant.
However, sheathing it again presents some problems. (Also, implanting
the organ gives you ``TRAIT_MORBID``, which I'll explain in a bit)

The Vorpal Scythe has 10 force, one of the weakest null rod variants for
force that isn't a joke null rod. However, it has exceptional armor pen
and also has 2 tiles of reach. So quite unique.

It also has a special beheading ability when you right-click someone.
This borrows some code from amputation shears, functioning pretty
similarly, except with a few additional ways to speed up the action and
restrictions. (It takes 15 seconds baseline to behead someone standing
and conscious, and speeds up or slows down based on factors such as
incapacitation and whether or not our scythe is already empowered)

When you successfully behead someone with a mind, the vorpal scythe
gains 20 force and can be safely stowed and drawn for 2 minutes.
Performing more death knells like this will reset the timer.

If it has not performed its 'death knell', or you haven't hit a living
mob, then it will cause severe damage to you if you ever try and stow it
(or its forced back into your arm). Just hitting a mob with the scythe
will sate it for 4 minutes. Unless it is a non-player monkey. Horrible
things. Just hitting mobs does not reset the timer on empowerment.

What this means is that the chaplain may be more hesitant to simply draw
their weapon on people. It also means that potentially, the chaplain
will not always have magic immunity, since they may end up stowing the
weapon away and be reluctant to draw it on a whim without either taking
damage for sheathing it without hitting something, or dealing with
having one less hand up until they can.

While empowerment only happens when you behead mobs with a mind,
beheading monkeyhumans and other mindless humans subtypes causes their
heads to become haunted! It's mostly harmless and largely just SpOoKy.
We don't want heads with actual players in them to go floating off to
space. (Does not work on monkey heads for sanity reasons)

When you have the Morbid trait, you think creepy stuff is cool and hate
saving peoples lives. You get a mood boost from graverobbing, autopsies,
dissections, amputations (including beheadings with the scythe and
amputations with the shears) and revival surgery. However, you get a
mood penalty when you tend wounds on the living, as well as a hefty
penalty when you perform CPR or defibrillate someone. I was thinking
Victor Frankenstein when I was choosing which actions had an associated
moodlet, so anything that I might have missed would be appreciated.

You also count as potentially cool with regards to haunted objects.
Ghosts think you're neat. (Revenants probably will still kill you if
they had the chance)
