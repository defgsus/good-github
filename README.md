WebXR: Severe aliasing in WebXR experiences (with WebGL1 contexts)
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=256861
rdar://109424254

Reviewed by Dan Glastonbury.

WebXR sessions using WebGL1 contexts are unable to turn on
multisampling. I'm pretty sure this was my fault, but I can't
remember if it was intentional or a mistake. Either way it is
a bug.

Fix this by implementing the multisample renderbuffer creation
and resolution steps. Since we're doing this on a WebGL1 context,
the normal API will be invalid (it requires GLES3), so call the
extension API instead. This means we need to expose some extra methods
on GraphicsContextGL.

Lastly, the framebuffer textures we get are SRGB8_ALPHA8 which
requires an extension to be enabled with a WebGL1 context when
we're talking to an XR-compatible context. Similarly, we
enable the extension to allow multisampled framebuffers.

Update eval-templates.md (#1090)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ‚ô•Ô∏è

üö® Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. üö®

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details üìë

### Eval name

[Insert Eval name here]

### Eval description

[Insert a short description of what your eval does here]

### What makes this a useful eval?

[Insert why this eval is worth including and any additional context]

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [ ] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [ ] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [ ] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [ ] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure üèóÔ∏è

Your eval should

- [ ] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [ ] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [ ] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist üëÄ

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [ ] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [ ] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [ ] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [ ] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [ ] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

This is so scuffed

Haven't worked on this in a while so I wanted to check it out. Ended up making some changes to some pretty obviously fucked up code. and adding some features.

 - Revised Camera Controller. Now has a toggle for an "active state".
 - Active state toggles call a callback that can be set by the user. In the example, I made it show/hide the mouse, but it could be used for something else, like pausing the physics or something... I guess?
 - Fixed some scuffed if/else statements replacing them with slightly less scuffed code that isn't as repetitive and works the same aside from normalizing the movement direction vector, which should have should have been happening before ANYWAY.
 - Made it so that the mouse sensitivity in the camera controller actually does something along with the movement speed.
 - Changed the way that keybinds for the cam controller work because the old way was sketchy as hell. This new one is more expandable for stuff in the future I guess.
 - Added a basic ass lighting test thing, meaning now there are more controls in the uniform control panel thingy (I forgot what it's called and I don't want to go and look). That's about it. It looks better now I guess.

Overall just the camera controller is a little more robust.

Update README.md

Introduction
What follows is the reasonable manner and conditions to use the Creative Commons license mentioned above. To be crystal clear, a license is a simple agreement or contract between two reasonable persons, who act in good faith to agree their wills regards to the thing and the price. The two reasonable persons here are: ‚Äúthe licensor‚Äù (Charles Kocian as the author of the ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù), who makes a contract with ‚Äúthe licensee‚Äù, (the person who is going to use the ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù to make its own artistic creations). In this case the thing, is the ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù. It is the text of 94 philosophical questions and its 94 short answers. The short answers are part of a book called Champion‚Äôs Renaissance and the philosophical questions are the questions of a game called Exceptional Mind. The book acts as the answers book of the questions of the game. This two works were (fictionally) created by the characters of Charles Kocian novel called One Exceptional Mind. The author of all this artistic works is Charles Kocian and, although they are the context of the ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù, they are not the ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù itself, therefore, are not under this CC BY-ND license. All rights of the novel, book and game are reserved to Charles Kocian under copyright ¬© international laws.
Being the novel, book and game the greater context of the ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù, we strongly recommend ‚Äúthe licensees‚Äù to create their art works after reading them and playing the game, to understand the context and avoid producing ‚Äúadapted material‚Äù, something that is prohibited by this license, (read it below), accordingly to Section 1.a.
About the license material
The ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù (the text sentences of the numbered questions of the game and the numbered short answers of the book described in the list below) are also under the Copyright ¬© and Similar Rights held by ‚Äúthe licensor‚Äù. To comply this license ‚Äúthe licensee‚Äù must assure the following. First, he needs to maintain the ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù unchanged, that is, the texts of the sentences of the questions and answers cannot be adapted, change, altered, arranged, transformed, or modified without ‚Äúthe licensor‚Äù permission. These sentences of questions and answers as presented below are the prime matter that ‚Äúthe licensee‚Äù will use to its own creations. Second, ‚Äúthe licensee‚Äù is allowed to add images in connection to the text. (This accordingly of what says in https://certificates.creativecommons.org, in 2. Adaptations 5. It says that, ‚Äúas a legal matter, at times it is tricky to determine exactly what is and is not an adaptation‚Äù, but then recommend some rules about the licenses to keep in mind, saying that, ‚Äúincluding an image in connection with text, as in a blog post, a powerpoint, or an article, does not create an adaptation unless the photo itself is adapted‚Äù). In this case, the ‚Äúlicence material‚Äù is only text, therefore, any kind of image or other mean except text can be connected to it, and that action will not produce ‚Äúadapted material‚Äù. So, we encourage ‚Äúthe licensee‚Äù to create its own copyright pictures, paintings, draws, videos and animations, including sounds, voice, music and other forms of art or interactions and connect them to the text of the ‚Äúlicence material‚Äù. They are allowed to do this but with three conditions. 
Firstly, (and the fundamental one), is to connect the text of the ‚Äúlicence material‚Äù with the images of their own creation (or other designs, things or actions they may invent), but with the condition to clarify the meaning of the text of the ‚Äúlicence material‚Äù and enhance it, especially for a clear audio-visual understanding of the question and a clear audio-visual explanation of its answer. All creations must have high quality standards of production, materials and aesthetic requirements. They must be done in a luxury style, use Cinzel and Cormorant fonts, dark purple backgrounds, gold and silver colours, including light grey, black and white backgrounds too, and in a similar style of the championsrenaissance website and the game aesthetics. (Luxury products websites such as Rolls-Royce, Rolex, Michelangelo‚Äôs David, Monalisa, Rafael paintings and Parthenon are aesthetics references as well, and in music: Mozart, Bach, Beethoven and Rachmaninov. We view art ONLY as aesthetic pleasure derived from nature‚Äôs order. Any kind of human voice music (including opera) is not allowed and out of our aesthetic natural standards. Modern slow electronic and fashion show music are allowed, as the same are used in advertising of luxury products, harmonious, happy and grateful music to relax in refined styles (heavy metal, hard rock, reggaeton and the like are prohibited). In visual design, the golden number proportion and Fibonacci sequence is welcomed too, and especially works derived from natural patterns, and also natural landscapes like mountains, stars, clouds and sea as well, because we understand beauty exist in nature‚Äôs order. The images, sounds, voices and music produced in audio-visual works will follow and support the narrative of the text without adding new letters or text, or changing the words for synonyms, or altering the sequence of words. In short, the meaning of the sentences of the ‚Äúlicensed material‚Äù cannot be altered, change or distorted by improper images, sounds, music or any other type of actions. For creations of videos for YouTube, must be videos of one question and answer at a time. Each video will be between 30 seconds to 5 minutes accordingly to a simple Format described below. All other type of creations will follow a format described below as well. Again, and to be out of doubt, sentences of a complete answer are ‚Äúas is" and described in the ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù below. They cannot be cut or turn around, add signs between letters or words. The text of the answers can be used in books with images, T- shirts, cups, posters, pictures memes, illuminated signs, songs, art paintings, or others, but each of them accordingly to the Format and the ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù. In case of a painter or photographer artist‚Äôs book, they must produce them with high quality paper and luxury style, using the text of one question and answer at a time, in one or more pages, but never more than one per page to not confuse. Group of different artists can make collective works, for instance, one producing music, other draws, paintings or artistic photographs, or one programmer can use Blender to create 3D virtual shapes and other programmer can use Godot to create an animation using those shapes, both joining their talents, for example, to create a video that explains audio-visually one question and answer of the ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù. Different artists can join to expose their creations in art galleries showing, for instance, its paintings or photographs, or produce a collective exposition to show different collections of paintings and photographs each with one question and answer. A coordinated effort like that will help them for a bigger media coverage and to attract interest of high-end galleries and sponsors of luxury brands and high-end organizations, such as Benetau Yatchs, Airbus Helicopters, Rolls-Royce, Rolex or Parker, Versailles, Windsor Castle or the Louvre and British Museums, Cambridge, Oxford, Le Sorbonne, Harvard or MIT and other top-level institutions of the world.
The second condition of the contributors‚Äô licensees to create their visual creations, plainly and short, is to make a direct or indirect advertisement of the book and game of Charles Kocian to increase its sales. This is accordingly to the attribution required for this license that says in Section 3.a.1.A.i (Licence Conditions and Attributions) that ‚Äúthe licensee‚Äù or user of this license needs to identify the author of the ‚Äúlicensed material‚Äù, in this case Charles Kocian. The text of this license says that ‚Äúthe licensor‚Äù can request to receive attribution in a reasonable manner. His request to receive attribution through the advertising of its book and game to increase its sales is a reasonable manner for the following reasons. Firstly, because the sale of its book and game supports him economically, so he can continue doing its work. Secondly, because the better the sales the more people will be playing the game and reading the book, and that will allow them to become exceptional minds and achieve their personal eudaimonia. (Eudaimonia is the holistic highest happiness possible for a virtuous man, being a virtuous man a virtuous-rational-animal who decided to practice the morality of reason to achieve its greater wealth in every sense, a deep happiness derived from the Aristotelian-telos-fulfilment as it is explained in the book. The objective of the book, game and novel is to help people to achieve eudaimonia). Thirdly, because the more people become exceptional minds and achieve eudaimonia, the smarter the world will be (applied to rulers and ruled) in the current and future generations. This is why Charles Kocian created the King Neo New Renaissance Movement, whose vision is to ease human species evolution to excellence perfecting the morality of reason. The ‚Äúlicensees‚Äù, by doing their creations, will contribute to implement the vision‚Äôs movement. These are enough reasons that allow ‚Äúthe licensor‚Äù to request attribution in the manner he is asking for. It is a win-win reasonable deal that benefit a smarter humanity and create not a future idiocracy, but a future smartcracy. To fulfil the licensor request in this manner, ‚Äúthe licensees‚Äù contributors will include in their creations, images of the book and game as they exist in the championsrenaissance website, without changing its colours images or fonts. They may use them in any kind of creations showing them from different perspectives, in movement or not, but maintaining its proportions and shape in creative ways. They are required to include a URL or hyperlink in a relevant place of their creations to grab people's attention, so they can click through and go to a sales page on the championsrenaissance website where the book and game are sold. Creations of paper artistic books with images, collections of photographs (or paintings) or expositions in art galleries, those works must clearly explain to the users where to buy the book and game. WARNING: The ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù cannot be used as parts or inserts of other artistic works (like a painting inside another painting) or commercial advertising campaigns or by activists or political campaigns, or in signs or any other kind of propaganda of collective movements, protests indoors or outdoors. The only purpose of ‚Äúthe licensees‚Äù to create their art works and connect them to the ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù text, is to ease human species evolution to excellence perfecting the morality of reason, but a reason based on evidence, tolerance, science, logic and nature‚Äôs beauty, and do it in proper peaceful contexts, civilized beautiful, elegant, stylish, refined and natural contexts. We resonate with Aristotle and its intellectual descendants like Hypatia of Alexandria, Ayn Rand, the Parthenon, the Renaissance of Medici‚Äôs Florence Family, who sponsored Leonardo, Michelangelo and Galileo, and also with Voltaire, Orwell, Newton, Einstein, Darwin, Ludwig von Mises and Carl Sagan among others whose minds respected the laws of nature. We resonate with nature‚Äôs beauty and the deep original folklore of all ethnicities around the world who absorbs the beauty of natural patterns into their artistic traditions. We are not in politics but we defend the individual freedom of choice and free markets without initiating brute force or deception to others. One more warning about ‚Äúadapted material‚Äù and to be out of doubt. Creations must be done using the text of one question and answer at a time, but using images, music and sound that will not distort, change the meaning or diminish the original message of the sentences, but enhance and enrich a clear and deeper understanding of the ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù. Creating an unproper visual, sound or music or any other kind of improper context will distort the original text message of the ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù and will produce without doubt ‚Äúadapted material‚Äù, something that is prohibited by this license, accordingly what it says in Section 1.a. of the CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NODERIVATIVES 4.0 INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC LICENSE. ‚ÄúAdapted material‚Äù is prohibited and cannot be share without the permission of ‚Äúthe Licensor‚Äù or author. 
The third purpose for creating these art works and connect them to the text of the ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù, is to benefit the creator‚Äôs contributors‚Äô ‚Äúlicensees‚Äù themselves. Indeed, it is an opportunity for them to show its artistic talents to the world in a wider cultural context. Through its own great works, creators can show their unique professional talent to an educated public, communicating them their design exceptional capabilities. It is an opportunity to expand its scope and attract new potential clients to their businesses, and allow them to know that they are committed contributors who share the same values of the King Neo New Renaissance Movement. WARNING: The copyright of the ‚Äúlicensees‚Äù creations, in case they use a Creative Common license applied to their creations, must assure that will not produce future production of ‚Äúadapted material‚Äù from the original ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù here presented, therefore, they must use the same CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NODERIVATIVES 4.0 INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC LICENSE. In whatever case, ‚Äúlicensees‚Äù, in their creative works, are obliged to publish a notice that refers to this Public License accordingly what says in its Section 3 (a), (1), (A), (iii) (ii), and (iv). 
King Neo Logo ¬©
Exceptional ‚Äúlicensees‚Äù who produce excellent works may be invited to enter the King Neo New Renaissance Movement Board Administrators. Those who accept are allow to use the King Neo ¬© logo in their creations. 

Administrators
Administrators of the Board will maintain the GitHub page of the community, supervise the Code of Conduct, review the works of other ‚Äúlicensees‚Äù and will have preferences when some opportunities appear.

Code of conduct 
Introduction
The premise of this adult reasonable community is that nobody is here against its will. It is a good faith community of educated and good faith with resources individuals who are here with no ulterior purpose except to produce art. We understand art as beauty derived from nature‚Äôs order. Here we use art in regard to enhance and enrich the explanation of the ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù. Everybody is free to join or leave the community as many times as it wishes. But anyone who violates the Code of Conduct will lose his reputation inside the community and will not be allowed to come back again. This Code of Conduct begins with the basic of following the law of the person‚Äôs country. This mean that people with criminal trials or charges, national or international, cannot join or stay in the community. Dishonest politicians, members with hidden agendas of NGO, or any other type of activists or members of organizations which their main objectives are against or may distort, distract or deviate the objectives of this community, they cannot be part or stay in this community. If they are part of any other community, public or secret, they must act in good faith to tell the truth when they sign the conditions to join this, at the moment when they fill the form to enter this community, a form where this kind of questions are asked. No member of this community can be in illegal conducts, such as the use of drugs or any other illegal activity. Although in this community we don‚Äôt discriminate gender, ethnicity or religion, this community is compound of high-educated moral persons of any race and in any country, but they all have a strong rational, secular and scientific approach to life, and with a great ambition to create art as beauty derived from nature‚Äôs order. Not everybody needs to agree with this view, but those who we do, we like to share with others like us to enrich our creations and expand the philosophical knowledge contained in the book and game. Because we believe man is a rational animal, we condemn the irrational as anti-human. Any irrational conduct is not tolerated. We respect the people who disagree with us and we request from them the same respect to disagree with their disagreement. This is not a place of debate of people who disagree with each other. That place exists in social media but is not the purpose of this community. The only purpose of this community is to integrate artistic images to the ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù here provided by people who share our Aristotelian philosophic values. We don‚Äôt tolerate rational contradictions. We don‚Äôt tolerate the negation of the Law of Identity formulated by Aristotle that says A is A. Having said that, here is a list of the Code of Conduct members of the community. We start with the premise that everybody in the community agree with the values exposed in the book and the game, and that they act in good faith. (Abuse reports can be done in abuse@whatever.com. We will take your report seriously). People with contradictions or against the values of the community cannot enter or stay. What we do in this community is like doing a sport. If somebody don‚Äôt like this sport, he can find other in another place. Administrators of the community reserve the right to take whatever action they feel appropriate with regards to the Code of Conduct violations. What follows is a list of good conducts the members of the community must observe.

Good conducts

1.	Empathetic rational conversation. Be rational and understand that emotions derived from thoughts. Make people feel welcome, supported and never insult or discriminate. Behave as a well-educated aristocrat.
2.	Don‚Äôt be offended. If somebody disagree with you, breathe, be calm, carry on. Act rationally, ask why and perhaps you can learn something.
3.	No emotional hysteria. Be cool, calm and stylish. Put your rational Neocortex as the ruler of your Paleocortex. Control your chimp rate, as players do when they crown themselves playing the game. Count to 10 before acting. Postpone your opinion or sending an email or insult or saying something in bad faith that you may repent later. Just be patient and wait for 3 days before acting if you are in any kind of emotional irrational storm. Always act controlling your emotions and find the real causes of your exaggerated emotional reaction. Always ride the horse and don‚Äôt let the horse ride you. It doesn‚Äôt look good.
4.	We suggest to read the book and play the game as many times as possible, every month.
5.	Never initiate force or deception to others.
6.	Treat others as you expect they treat you.
7.	Judge but rationally and expect to be judged rationally.
8.	Don‚Äôt initiate conversations or debates beyond the purpose of the community that is no other than to add images to the text of the ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù. There are other places for that.
9.	Try to see the rational genius and hero in others.
10.	We suggest to practice the morality of reason as it is explained in the book and its bibliography.
11.	Good faith premise. Accept a person you don‚Äôt know in good faith, who is not deliberately trying to deceit you, but report if he proves to act in bad faith.
12.	Listen without interruption in good faith, believing he is talking rationally and good faith. 
13.	Use language with words definitions as the 1960‚Äôs dictionaries say.
14.	 If you don‚Äôt understand something, identify what words are blur and ask your interlocutor definitions for them.
15.	Use precise concepts definitions attached to percepts. Ask for definitions and to what facts or evidence those words are attached.
16.	We don‚Äôt ask for people to apologize or feel guilty or to ask ‚Äúemotional forgiveness‚Äù, but to rationally recognize the logic cause of an error to not repeat it again. 
17.	Secularism. We are guided by Aristotle‚Äôs ontology. We don‚Äôt believe that knowledge is inherent as Plato did, but is gradually acquired through our senses as Aristotle concluded. We seek truth through the scientific method. We believe in the primacy of existence over consciousness not vice-versa.
18.	Religious and political debates, hidden agendas or open activism is completely prohibited.
19.	Think big.

Evaluation system
Before publishing their artistic works, the ‚Äúlicensees‚Äù can show them to the administrators of the community to receive feedback, with the four categories of evaluation. Excellent, Good, Average and Unacceptable. As it was said, those who are ‚Äúexcellent exceptional‚Äù may be invited to join the King Neo New Renaissance Movement Board Administrators. 

Ranking of works
The GitHub community administrators will vote every three months for the best works of that period and produce a ranking that will be published in GitHub and the championsrenaissance website.

Formats
All the artistic visual works that the ‚Äúlicensees‚Äù will create, adding or integrating audio or visual elements to the text of the ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù needs to be done with a format or template. The format consists to follow sequential steps. The first step (at the beginning of a video or at the top of the visual composition) consist to write and say the number of the question to easily identify it. It must say ‚ÄúQuestion N¬∞ 1‚Äù (or the correspondent number) in big Cinzel black fonts.  The second step is to write and say: ‚ÄúA question of the Exceptional Mind Philosophical Game‚Äù. It can be done in Cinzel and Cormorant fonts. Pauses and spaces can be design at the unique criteria of the artist. The third step in the sequence is to write the complete sentence of the question and its alternatives. The fourth step is to write the complete sentence of the answer. The fifth step is to advertise the game and book writing and saying the message: ‚ÄúFind the book and game here‚Äù, providing a link to the sales page in the championsrenaissance website or were to buy them. The last step is the advertising of the ‚Äúlicensees‚Äù themselves, where the creators can use their logos, signatures, slogans, etc., to communicate to potential clients their work and talents. This last step will repeat the fifth step providing people clear data where to buy the book and game. This manner of attribution the licensor is requesting is a reasonable request, accordingly to Section 3.a of this license. As it was said and to be out of doubt, we insist that all works cannot produce confusion. For instance, videos must contain only one answer per video, and need to be between 30 seconds and 5 minutes each. In case of photographs, paintings or sculptures, only one answer at a time in each artistic work. Books of photographs, draws or images must contain all the answers, or divided in two book‚Äôs volumes as they are divided in the parts of the book. Creators can use one or more pages to show one answer, but not two answers in the same page. The purpose of this format is to help the understanding of the question and its answers and not to confuse. The same is suggested for paintings, artistic photography, installations or sculptures. In case of short theatrical performances, TV shows with public with question-answers contests (like Jeopardy), or TV shows to play the game in teams (similar to the novel) in a big board with public, or in case of interactive cognitive museums, or expositions, the same criteria of the format apply. Also, for any kind of apps or merchandising things, such as T-shirts, cups, huts and the like or any other invention that help to spread the text of the ‚Äúlicense material‚Äù will follow the same criteria of this format.

The eye receives light; the ear, sound; nose, odours, etc. The reception of distal stimulus is the 2nd stage of sensory perception.
15	The process of converting the distal stimulus to proximal stimulus (or nerve impulse) is called transduction.	True	False 	a	Transduction is the 3rd stage of perception. It occurs when the distal stimulus received (light, sound, smell, etc.) is converted by the sensory cell to proximal stimulus or nerve electrical impulse.
16	In the 4th stage of sensory perception, the paleocortex interprets the electric impulses.	True	False 	a	The paleocortex interprets the proximal stimulus (or nerve electrical impulse). He compares it with the data in his memory and denies it if it seems dangerous, preventing the neocortex from being informed of reality.
17	The fifth stage of sensory perception occurs when the neocortex rationally analyses the electric impulses according to the premises of its cultural mold.	True	False 	a	The fifth stage of sensory perception is possible only when the neocortex receives information from the proximal stimulus.
18	What is the Comfort Zone?	Neural pathways derived from focusing the mind and critical thinking.	Neural highways derived from cultural imprinting and mental habits.	b	The Comfort Zone is the easiest way where nerve impulses circulate in your brain, automatically, with no or little critical thinking.

40	Do you perceive according to the identity of your sensory organs?	Yes	No	a	Each sensory organ has its own identity. No ear sees, no nose listens; each sense organ is what it is and acts according to its identity, that is, accordingly to the Law of Causality.
41	Are your sense organs absolute?	Yes	No	a	Your sense organs are absolute for you, because they are given and natural tools of survival, the result of more than four billion years of biological evolution on Earth.  
42	Does the concept "unity" have any role in forming a concept?	Yes	No	a	To consider "entities" as "units" is man's cognitive method. For example, the characteristics of the entities "spoons" are consider as a unit that groups them in the "spoon" concept.
43	Forming a concept involves a mathematical calculation.	True	False 	a	Forming a concept involves a mathematical calculation, because it identifies a common characteristic to measure it.
44	A concept identifies the common characteristic of the entities that own it, and refers to a specific measurement of a particular entity.

46	In the Allegory of Photo Albums and Folders, what is a basic concept?	An album with photos of the same things.	A folder with photos of the same things.	a	A "basic concept" is like a photo album with pictures of the same things, the kind of concepts closest to the perceptual level.
47	In the Allegory of Photo Albums and Folders, how is a 1st level concept represented?	With a photo album containing multiple folders.	With a folder containing multiple photo albums.	b	With a 1st level folder containing several photo albums. An example is "fruit".

54	The meaning of one concept depends on the meaning of all the others.	True	False 	a	The meaning of a concept depends on the meaning of others because words define words and, therefore, build mental contexts.
55	What is hierarchy when learning?	That first you learn to multiply and then to count.	That you go to school first then to college.	b	Knowledge is constructed from bottom to up, like a building. First "percepts", then "concepts". You learn to count, then to multiply; before a Newton, a Galileo was necessary. There are no shortcuts to knowledge.
56	To validate a concept, you have to reverse engineer it.	True	False 	a	To reverse engineer a concept you have to see how the percepts connect to the concepts. It is done by opening the folders of higher levels until you reach the photo albums.

62	Logic is the art of definitions.	True	False 	b	Logic is the science of non-contradictions. But the conclusion of a syllogism, although logically right, it can be factually wrong if it contains floating concepts.
63	Are the concepts of "possible," "probable," and "certain" referring to the same thing?	Yes	No	b	When there is no evidence against and some in favour, something is "possible"; if there is enough evidence, but there are still doubts, something is "probable"; if the evidence is conclusive, its "certain", because it leaves no room for doubt.

diff: detect pathspec magic not supported by --follow

The --follow code doesn't handle most forms of pathspec magic. We check
that no unexpected ones have made it to try_to_follow_renames() with a
runtime GUARD_PATHSPEC() check, which gives behavior like this:

  $ git log --follow ':(icase)makefile' >/dev/null
  BUG: tree-diff.c:596: unsupported magic 10
  Aborted

The same is true of ":(glob)", ":(attr)", and so on. It's good that we
notice the problem rather than continuing and producing a wrong answer.
But there are two non-ideal things:

  1. The idea of GUARD_PATHSPEC() is to catch programming errors where
     low-level code gets unexpected pathspecs. We'd usually try to catch
     unsupported pathspecs by passing a magic_mask to parse_pathspec(),
     which would give the user a much better message like:

       pathspec magic not supported by this command: 'icase'

     That doesn't happen here because git-log usually _does_ support
     all types of pathspec magic, and so it passes "0" for the mask
     (this call actually happens in setup_revisions()). It needs to
     distinguish the normal case from the "--follow" one but currently
     doesn't.

  2. In addition to --follow, we have the log.follow config option. When
     that is set, we try to turn on --follow mode only when there is a
     single pathspec (since --follow doesn't handle anything else). But
     really, that ought to be expanded to "use --follow when the
     pathspec supports it". Otherwise, we'd complain any time you use an
     exotic pathspec:

       $ git config log.follow true
       $ git log ':(icase)makefile' >/dev/null
       BUG: tree-diff.c:596: unsupported magic 10
       Aborted

     We should instead just avoid enabling follow mode if it's not
     supported by this particular invocation.

This patch expands our diff_check_follow_pathspec() function to cover
pathspec magic, solving both problems.

A few final notes:

  - we could also solve (1) by passing the appropriate mask to
    parse_pathspec(). But that's not great for two reasons. One is that
    the error message is less precise. It says "magic not supported by
    this command", but really it is not the command, but rather the
    --follow option which is the problem. The second is that it always
    calls die(). But for our log.follow code, we want to speculatively
    ask "is this pathspec OK?" and just get a boolean result.

  - This is obviously the right thing to do for ':(icase)' and most
    other magic options. But ':(glob)' is a bit odd here. The --follow
    code doesn't support wildcards, but we allow them anyway. From
    try_to_follow_renames():

	#if 0
	        /*
	         * We should reject wildcards as well. Unfortunately we
	         * haven't got a reliable way to detect that 'foo\*bar' in
	         * fact has no wildcards. nowildcard_len is merely a hint for
	         * optimization. Let it slip for now until wildmatch is taught
	         * about dry-run mode and returns wildcard info.
	         */
	        if (opt->pathspec.has_wildcard)
	                BUG("wildcards are not supported");
	#endif

    So something like "git log --follow 'Make*'" is already doing the
    wrong thing, since ":(glob)" behavior is already the default (it is
    used only to countermand an earlier --noglob-pathspecs).

    So we _could_ loosen the guard to allow :(glob), since it just
    behaves the same as pathspecs do by default. But it seems like a
    backwards step to do so. It already doesn't work (it hits the BUG()
    case currently), and given that the user took an explicit step to
    say "this pathspec should glob", it is reasonable for us to say "no,
    --follow does not support globbing" (or in the case of log.follow,
    avoid turning on follow mode). Which is what happens after this
    patch.

  - The set of allowed pathspec magic is obviously the same as in
    GUARD_PATHSPEC(). We could perhaps factor these out to avoid
    repetition. The point of having separate masks and GUARD calls is
    that we don't necessarily know which parsed pathspecs will be used
    where. But in this case, the two are heavily correlated. Still,
    there may be some value in keeping them separate; it would make
    anyone think twice about adding new magic to the list in
    diff_check_follow_pathspec(). They'd need to touch
    try_to_follow_renames() as well, which is the code that would
    actually need to be updated to handle more exotic pathspecs.

  - The documentation for log.follow says that it enables --follow
    "...when a single <path> is given". We could possibly expand that to
    say "with no unsupported pathspec magic", but that raises the
    question of documenting which magic is supported. I think the
    existing wording of "single <path>" sufficiently encompasses the
    idea (the forbidden magic is stuff that might match multiple
    entries), and the spirit remains the same.

[evals] reverse sort english words (includes duplicates) (#876)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ‚ô•Ô∏è

üö® Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. üö®

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details üìë
### Eval name
reverse-sort-words-eng

### Eval description

Each eval consists of 10 comma-separated english words that should be
sorted in correct reverse alphabetic order. Includes duplicate words. 25
samples.

### What makes this a useful eval?

- Evaluates ability to organizing words
- Evaluates ability to follow the exact guidance

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure üèóÔ∏è

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist üëÄ

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.
chris@multix.de

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

serial: core: Allow processing sysrq at port unlock time

[ Upstream commit d6e1935819db0c91ce4a5af82466f3ab50d17346 ]

Right now serial drivers process sysrq keys deep in their character
receiving code.  This means that they've already grabbed their
port->lock spinlock.  This can end up getting in the way if we've go
to do serial stuff (especially kgdb) in response to the sysrq.

Serial drivers have various hacks in them to handle this.  Looking at
'8250_port.c' you can see that the console_write() skips locking if
we're in the sysrq handler.  Looking at 'msm_serial.c' you can see
that the port lock is dropped around uart_handle_sysrq_char().

It turns out that these hacks aren't exactly perfect.  If you have
lockdep turned on and use something like the 8250_port hack you'll get
a splat that looks like:

  WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected
  [...] is trying to acquire lock:
  ... (console_owner){-.-.}, at: console_unlock+0x2e0/0x5e4

  but task is already holding lock:
  ... (&port_lock_key){-.-.}, at: serial8250_handle_irq+0x30/0xe4

  which lock already depends on the new lock.

  the existing dependency chain (in reverse order) is:

         dw8250_handle_irq+0x98/0xcc
         serial8250_interrupt+0x50/0xe8
         ...

  other info that might help us debug this:

   Possible unsafe locking scenario:

         CPU0                    CPU1
         ----                    ----
    lock(&port_lock_key);
                                 lock(console_owner);
                                 lock(&port_lock_key);
    lock(console_owner);

   *** DEADLOCK ***

The hack used in 'msm_serial.c' doesn't cause the above splats but it
seems a bit ugly to unlock / lock our spinlock deep in our irq
handler.

It seems like we could defer processing the sysrq until the end of the
interrupt handler right after we've unlocked the port.  With this
scheme if a whole batch of sysrq characters comes in one irq then we
won't handle them all, but that seems like it should be a fine
compromise.

torch.compiler public namespace (#102182)

# torch.compiler public API

## Goal

The goal of this document is to describe the public facing API for torchdynamo and torchinductor.

Today both dynamo and torchinductor are in `torch/_dynamo` and `torch/_inductor` namespace with the only public function

`torch.compile()` which is directly placed in `torch/__init__.py`

This poses a few problems for users trying to take dependencies on PyTorch 2.0
1. Unclear BC guarantees
2. No builtin discovery mechanism outside of reading the source code
3. No hard requirements for docstrings or type annotations

Most importantly it mixes two personas the PyTorch 2.0 developer vs the PyTorch 2.0 customer so this is an attempt to address this. We draw a lot of inspiration from the `functorch` migration to the `func` namespace.

## Alternate names

We did discuss some other alternative names

1. `torch.compile` -> problem is this would break BC on the existing `torch.compile` function
2. `torch.dynamo` -> `dynamo` is so far not something we've deliberately hidden from users but problem is now figuring out what it's `_dynamo` vs `dynamo` might be confusing
3. `torch.compiler` -> 1 would be better but to keep BC this is a good compromise

# The general approach
## Proposal 1
In https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_dynamo/__init__.py

We have function called `reset()`, this function is essential if users are trying to `torch.compile()` a model under different settings

```python
# in _dynamo/
def reset():
    do_reset_stuff()
```

Instead we propose

```python
# in compiler/
def reset():
    do_reset_stuff() # As in copy paste the logic from _dynamo.reset

# in _dynamo/
import warnings
import inspect

def reset():
    function_name = inspect.currentframe().f_code.co_name
    warnings.warn(f"{function_name} is deprecated, use compiler.{function_name} instead", DeprecationWarning)
    return compiler.reset()

```
## Proposal 2

```python
# in compiler/
def reset():
    ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù
    Docstrings here
    ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù
    _dynamo.reset()

# in _dynamo/
No changes
```
Consensus so far seems to be proposal 2 since fewer warnings will be less jarring and it‚Äôll make it quite easy to merge the public API

## Docstrings

The above was an example of a function that has no inputs or outputs but there are other functions which could use an improvement in their docstrings, for example allow_in_graph actually works over lists of functions but that‚Äôs not mentioned anywhere in the example only if you read the source code.

def allow_in_graph(fn):
    """
    Customize which functions TorchDynamo will include in the generated
    graph. Similar to `torch.fx.wrap()`.

    Parameters:
        fn (callable or list/tuple): The function(s) to be allowed in the graph.

    Returns:
        callable or list/tuple: The input function(s) included in the graph.

    Examples:
        Customize inclusion of a single function:
        ::
            torch._dynamo.allow_in_graph(my_custom_function)

        Customize inclusion of multiple functions:
        ::
            torch._dynamo.allow_in_graph([my_custom_function1, my_custom_function2])

        @torch._dynamo.optimize(...)
        def fn(a):
            x = torch.add(x, 1)
            x = my_custom_function(x)
            x = torch.add(x, 1)
            return x

        fn(...)

    Notes:
        The `allow_in_graph` function allows customization of which functions TorchDynamo
        includes in the generated graph. It can be used to include specific functions that
        are not automatically captured by TorchDynamo.

        If `fn` is a list or tuple, `allow_in_graph` will be called recursively on each
        element in the sequence.

        Once a function is allowed in the graph using `allow_in_graph`, it will be captured
        in the graph generated by TorchDynamo. This customization enables more fine-grained
        control over the functions included in the graph.

        Note that `allow_in_graph` expects the input `fn` to be a callable.

    """
    if isinstance(fn, (list, tuple)):
        return [allow_in_graph(x) for x in fn]
    assert callable(fn), "allow_in_graph expects a callable"
    allowed_functions._allowed_function_ids.add(id(fn))
    allowed_functions._disallowed_function_ids.remove(id(fn))
    return fn

So to make the API public, we‚Äôd have to write similar docstrings for all public functions we‚Äôd like to create.

The benefit of this approach is that
1. No BC risks, internal and external users relying on our tooling can slowly wean off the private functions.
2. We will also have to write correct docstrings which will automatically make our documentation easier to maintain and render correctly on pytorch.org
3. We already have some BC guarantees already, we don‚Äôt kill OptimizedModule, we rejected the PR to change the config system

The con of this approach is that
Will be stuck with some potentially suboptimal functions/classes that you can‚Äôt kill

## Testing strategy
If the approach is to mostly make a public function call an already tested private function then all we need to do is ensure that the function signatures don't change

## Which functions should be in the public API

Our heuristic for deciding whether something should be public or not is are users already relying on it for lack of other options or have we recommended some non public functions for users to debug their PT 2.0 programs.

Heuristic for not putting something in public is that it‚Äôs an experimental subsystem with the goal of turning it on by default, it‚Äôs very core dev centric, meta centric, a bunch of different configs that should be batched into a single user facing one, or something that needs to be renamed because the name is confusing

#### Top level
`torch.compile()` -> already is a public API it does require some minor improvements like having configs be passed in to any backend and not just inductor (EDIT: This was already done https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/99645l) and renaming `mode=reduce-overhead` to `mode=cudagraph`

To make sure that PT 2.0 is supported with a given pytorch version users can create a new public function and this would replace the need for `try/except` blocks around `import torch._dynamo` that has been populating user code.

```python
def pt2_enabled():
    if hasattr(torch, 'compile'):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

For all of the below they will be translated to `torch.compiler.function_name()`

#### From _dynamo

As a starting point we looked at https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_dynamo/__init__.py and we suggest redefining these functions in `pytorch/torch/compiler/__init__.py`

It might also make sense to split them over multiple files and import them in `__init__.py` but because the number of functions is small it'd probably be fine to add them all into a single compiler/__init__.py until this list becomes larger

1. `reset()`
2. `allow_in_graph()`
10. `list_backends()`
12. `compile()`:  torch.compile() would be mostly a shell function passing arguments to torch.compiler.compile()
13. `assume_constant_result()`: TODO: Double check how this is useful
15. `torch._dynamo.disable()`

Some notable omissions
11. `explain()`: We need to clean up the output for this function, make it a data class and pretty printable
1. `forbid_in_graph()`: Considered adding this but should instead consolidate on `disallow_in_graph`
2. `optimize_assert()`: Already covered by `torch.compile(fullgraph=True)`
3. `check_if_dynamo_supported()`: this would be supplanted by pt2_enabled()
4. `compilation_metrics`, `graph_breaks_reasons` ..: would all be accessed via `torch.compiler.explain()`
5. `replay` does not seem useful to end customers
6. . `graph_break()`: Mostly useful for debugging or unit tests
9. `register_backend()`: End users will just pass a string backend to torch.compile, only devs will create new backends
10. `export()` : Eventually this needs to public but for now it‚Äôs not ready so just highlighting that it will be in the public API eventually
11. `disallow_in_graph()`: Usage is limited
12. `mark_static()`: we can keep this private until dynamic=True is recommended in stable
13. `mark_dynamic()`:  we can keep this private until dynamic=True is recommended in trunk
14. 8. `OptimizedModule`: This is the only class that we'd expose but is crucial since users are running code like `if isinstance(mod, OptimizedModule): torch.save(mod._orig_mod)` EDIT: because we fixed pickling we no longer need to
expose this
15. `is_compiling()`: Still not clear how this useful to end users

There are also config variables which we need to expose https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_dynamo/config.py

Some of our configs are useful dev flags, others are to gate experimental functionality and others are essential debugging tools and we seperate out the essential debugging and logging tools to a public facing config.

TODO: I still need to think of a good way of porting the config in a BC way here are some ideas
1. Just make all passes available and controllable via `torch.compile(options={})` but only show docstrings for the ones users should care about.

The current problem with our config system is we have 3 ways of setting them once via `options={}`, environment variables and variables in `config.py`, it'd be worth settling on one source of truth and have that be the public API.

The configs we should make public are
1. `log_file_name`
2. `verbose`
3. `cache_size_limit`
4. `repro_level` and `repro_after`: Although we can rename these to minifier and give human readable names to the levels

Everything else should stay private in particular

1. `print_graph_breaks`, `print_specializations`: should be supplanted by `explain()` for public users
2. dynamic shape configs : Users should only have to worry about `torch.compile(dynamic=True/False)`
3. The distributed flags, hook or guard configs: If we tell a user to use FSDP and DDP then the flag should be enabled by default or be in a private namespace
4. The fbcode flags: Obviously no need to be user facing
5. Skip/Allow lists: Not something normal users should play around with

#### From _inductor
Very little of inductor should be exposed in a public facing API, our core audience as in people writing models mostly just need information on what certain passes mean and how to control them a high level and they can do this with `torch.compile(options={})` so the goal here should be more to make available passes clearer and ideally consolidate them into `torch.compile()` docstrings or modes.

There are some exceptions though from https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_inductor/__init__.py

1. `list_mode_options()`
2. `list_options()`: this needs an additional pass to hide internal or debug options

For both of these we‚Äôd rename them to compiler.inductor_list_mode_options and compiler.inductor_list_options() since they would be in the same init file as the one for dynamo

Notable omissions
1. `_inductor.compile()`: Because of users are coming in with their own fx graph, they are likely developers
2. `_inductor.aot_compile()`:Again this is about capturing and modifying fx graphs so users APIs don't need to be public

However the configs are a slightly different story, because we can choose to either
1. Make all configs public
2. Make some configs public and keep most of the private ones. If public config is set it should override the private version
3. Make all configs controllable via `torch.compile(options={})` but make list_options() hide more things

For now 3 seems like the most reasonable choice with some high level configs we‚Äôll keep like TORCH_COMPILE_DEBUG

Regardless here's what should probably be public or advertised more
1. `disable_progress` and verbose_progress:  Combine and enable by default
2. `fallback_random`: We could make the case this shouldn't be public if a top level deterministic mode enables this
3. `profile_bandwidth`: Or could make the case that this should be in TORCH_COMPILE_DEBUG

Notable omissions
1. Any config that would generally improve performance for most that we should probably enable by default but might be disabled in the short term because of stability: example `epilogue_fusion`, `pattern_matcher`, `reordering`
2. Autotuning flags: Should just sit behind `torch.compile(mode="max-autotune")` like `max_autotune`, `max_autotune_gemm`
3. `coordinate_descent_tuning`: This one I'm a but mixed about, maybe it just also fall into `mode="max-autotune"`
4. `trace`: `TORCH_COMPILE_DEBUG` is the best flag for all of this
5. `triton.cudagraphs`: Default should be `torch.compile(mode="reduce-overhead")` - I'd go further and rename the `mode=cudagraph` and we can keep reduce-overhead for BC reasons
6. `triton_unique_kernel_names`: Mostly useful for devs debugging
7. `dce`: which doesnt really do anything
8. `shape_padding`: Elias is working on enabling this by default in which case we also remove it

## Mechanics

This PR would include the public functions with their docstrings

Another PR will take a stab at the configs

And for work where the APIs are still being cleaned up whether its minifier or escape hatches, export or dynamic shapes, aot_inductor etc.. we‚Äôll keep them private until a public commitment can be made

Add option to `%autoreload` to hide errors when reloading code (#14056)

* We have `%autoreload` enabled by default in Spyder and think it's a
bit annoying to show its error messages to users because they make
little sense to them. These errors are not uncommon when you are working
with some code that is slightly different between two git branches.
* However, I didn't change the current behavior (i.e. showing errors)
because it's been like that for as long as I can remember. We'd simply
use the new `--hide-errors` option in our kernel.

Update AmbrosialEncrypt.cs (silly edition)

iceayy contribution attempt #1

removed alphaChars var ssince it was declared as private static, but never used outside of the GenerateRandomString method.. so we get rid of it!!! no more!! we hate!!!!!!!!!

removed checked keyword from GenerateRandomString method. it WAS used to make sure that integer arithmetic operations dont overflow, but this simply does not lol because the min value of the int is larger than the length of the alphachars string

replaced the strings.mid method with the char indexy thingamabooby. was uused to extract a single char from a string, buuuut we simplify by using the char indexer so it can be used to access a single char at a specific index in a string.

my c# skills are so silly
make sure to like and subscribe for more silly pull requests on the silliest website half of all programs rely on to not die randomly.

Warrior Nerf (#3424)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->

# About the pull request

This PR removes cooldown reduction on slash.

This PR slightly lowers fling and punch cooldowns.

This PR lowers fling stun to a micro stun and adds a slow.

This PR decreases lunge range to 4 tiles.

As a reminder design feedback and balance concerns go here:
https://forum.cm-ss13.com/w/pr-feedback/steps/step_1

# Explain why it's good for the game

Warrior rework has been on my mind for a while. I'm not quite sure how I
want to do it. The cooldowns on abilities and the abilities themselves
are incredibly powerful crowd control and just a few warriors can do
immense damage to large groups of marines. It's just... not in a great
place for a T2 and sadly I don't have a thorough game plan yet to rework
it into something more bearable while equally enjoyable to play. In the
mean time, this is what we're getting. Am I promising a rework in the
near future? Not really. It's on my list somewhere. Does warrior need
some changing around? Yeah.

Overall, this should make warrior a bit more bearable. We'll see. More
changes as testing goes.

fix stupid error message in delay pre-game

tabbing out during init after hitting the verb, while you wait for the server to un-lockup and present you with the prompt, and coming back in, noticing you were too late, and cancelling out of the time prompt, only to get told the round had already started, was kinda fucking lame.

Update TODOLIST.java

Problem

CodeChef recently revamped its practice page to make it easier for users to identify the next problems they should solve by introducing some new features:

    Recent Contest Problems - contains only problems from the last 2 contests
    Separate Un-Attempted, Attempted, and All tabs
    Problem Difficulty Rating - the Recommended dropdown menu has various difficulty ranges so that you can attempt the problems most suited to your experience
    Popular Topics and Tags

Like most users, Chef didn‚Äôt know that he could add problems to a personal to-do list by clicking on the magic '+' symbol on the top-right of each problem page. But once he found out about it, he went crazy and added loads of problems to his to-do list without looking at their difficulty rating.

Chef is a beginner and should ideally try and solve only problems with difficulty rating strictly less than 10001000. Given a list of difficulty ratings for problems in the Chef‚Äôs to-do list, please help him identify how many of those problems Chef should remove from his to-do list, so that he is only left with problems of difficulty rating less than 10001000.
Input Format

    The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, the number of test cases. Then the testcases follow.
    Each testcase consists of 2 lines of input.
    The first line of input of each test case contains a single integer, NN, which is the total number of problems that the Chef has added to his to-do list.
    The second line of input of each test case contains NN space-separated integers D1,D2,‚Ä¶,DND1‚Äã,D2‚Äã,‚Ä¶,DN‚Äã, which are the difficulty ratings for each problem in the to-do list.

Output Format

For each test case, output in a single line the number of problems that Chef will have to remove so that all remaining problems have a difficulty rating strictly less than 10001000.
Constraints

    1‚â§T‚â§10001‚â§T‚â§1000
    1‚â§N‚â§10001‚â§N‚â§1000
    1‚â§Di‚â§50001‚â§Di‚Äã‚â§5000

Subtasks

Explanation:

Test case 11: Among the three difficulty ratings, Chef only needs to remove the problem with difficulty rating 12001200, since it is ‚â•1000‚â•1000. So, the answer is 11.

Test case 22: Among the four difficulty ratings, Chef needs to remove the problems with difficulty ratings of 10001000, 10011001, and 10021002, since they are ‚â•1000‚â•1000. So, the answer is 33.

Test case 33: Among the five difficulty ratings, Chef needs to remove the problem with a difficulty rating of 50005000, since it is ‚â•1000‚â•1000. So, the answer is 11.

Test case 44: Chef needs to remove all the five problems, since they are all rated ‚â•1000‚â•1000. So, the answer is 55.

Test case 55: Chef does not need to remove any problem, since they are all rated <1000<1000. So, the answer is 00.

Counting bigrams in sentences (#302)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ‚ô•Ô∏è

üö® Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. üö®

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details üìë
### Eval name
Bigram Counting

### Eval description

Tests whether the model is able to count the frequency of bigrams in a
sentence.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This is a very simple task for humans and it's possibly slightly more
'difficult' than counting the occurrences of a single letter.

Bigram frequencies are used in applications ranging from rudimentary NLP
tasks to cryptography.

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure üèóÔ∏è

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.jsonl`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist üëÄ

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details üìë
### Eval name

belarusian-lexicon

### Eval description

Test the model's ability to distinguish between existing and
hallucinated Belarusian words.

### What makes this a useful eval?

While the multilingual capability of recent GPT models is impressive,
there is still room for improvement. Many human languages are lagging
far behind English in terms of the model's ability to answer questions
and produce coherent texts in these languages, and the model's
"knowledge" of their lexicon and grammar is, to some extent,
hallucinated. One example is Belarusian, an East Slavic language spoken
by several million people. In my experience with ChatGPT, when the model
is prompted in Belarusian, its responses are sometimes ungrammatical or
semantically incoherent, and very often they contain made-up words ‚Äì a
possible sign of overgeneralization based on Russian and Ukrainian data,
which are much more
[abundant](https://commoncrawl.github.io/cc-crawl-statistics/plots/languages)
on the web than Belarusian.

This eval contains 150 pairs of single-word prompts: one item in each
pair is a non-word hallucinated by ChatGPT (either totally meaningless
in Belarusian or violating the language's orthographic and phonetic
rules), and another item is an actual Belarusian word with similar
spelling. The model's task is to distinguish between words and
non-words. ChatGPT tends to label most items as existing words,
therefore its accuracy appears to be around 50%, and the negative-class
F measure is very low. Any competent speaker of Belarusian would perform
much better, and a language-specific tool, such as [this spell
checker](https://corpus.by/SpellChecker) or [this grammatical
database](https://bnkorpus.info/grammar.en.html) of Belarusian (also
available for
[download](https://github.com/Belarus/GrammarDB/releases)), would
flawlessly identify non-words.

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This eval an attempt to point out specific deficiencies in the model's
ability to handle a lower-resource language (Belarusian). As such, it
might not only benchmark future refinements of Belarusian language
capability in the GPT models, but also serve as an instructuve example
for other language communities.

## Eval structure üèóÔ∏è

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist üëÄ

Add emotional intelligence evaluation (#589)

## Eval details üìë
### Eval name
Emotional Intelligence

### Eval description
Evaluates GPT's ability to understand and manage emotional situations
using modified versions of the well-validated, public (i.e.
license-unrestricted) tests first developed by MacCann & Roberts (2008).
Items have actually here been aggregated across three different scales--
the STEU and STEM adult measures, along with a dozen questions from the
youth measure.

Keep in mind that there is not expectation that AI models like GPT-4
should be able to process emotions, so applying any emotional
intelligence test to them should be taken with a grain of salt. These
tests can only measure the AI's ability to understand and analyze
emotional information, not the AI's emotional intelligence in the human
sense.

### What makes this a useful eval?
This eval is useful because it assesses the AI model's ability to
navigate complex or ambiguous emotional situations, which is an
important aspect of human-like communication and problem-solving. By
evaluating the model's performance in this unique domain, we can
identify areas for improvement and better understand its limitations
when it comes to handling emotional contexts. This is particularly
important when considering AI applications that involve interactions
with humans, such as chatbots, personal assistants, and customer support
systems. A better understanding of emotional intelligence can
potentially lead to more natural and effective interactions between AI
models and their users.

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This Emotional Intelligence eval provides a unique value because by
testing GPT's capacity to understand and manage emotions, we can gain
insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses in a more
human-centric context. Relatedly, this eval also emphasizes the
importance of empathy and emotional understanding in AI systems that are
designed to interact with humans. By evaluating GPT's performance in
this way, we can contribute to the ongoing development of AI models that
are more attuned to human emotions and can provide better support in
emotionally charged situations, such as mental health counseling, crisis
management, and conflict resolution. Moreover, this Emotional
Intelligence eval can serve as a foundation for further research and
development in the field of AI and emotional understanding, paving the
way for more sophisticated AI models capable of handling complex human
emotions and fostering more effective communication.

## Eval structure üèóÔ∏è

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval
(data is publicly available on OSF, and does not have usage
restrictions)

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

Heart Disease Prediction (#538)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ‚ô•Ô∏è

üö® Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. üö®

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval

## Eval details üìë
### Eval name
Heart Disease Prediction

### Eval description

This eval tests the models ability to correctly predict the probability
of a patient to have heart disease. The dataset is constructed from the
[Heart Failure Prediction
Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)
on Kaggle. The data includes the patient's age, sex, and a number of
medical signals relevant to the diagnosis of heart disease.

The data is provided under the Open Database License (ODbL). 

```

```

### What makes this a useful eval?

This assesses the model's ability to correctly predict adverse medical
events. Correctly predicting heart disease shows the model's capability
for a strong understanding of medicine. The GPT-3.5-turbo models
currently receives an accuracy of 0.778.

Financial Math (Evals) (#566)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ‚ô•Ô∏è

üö® Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. üö®

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details üìë
### Eval name
finance

### Eval description

Asks the model to calculate how much interest would be owed on a credit
card by a certain date, if a payment was made once but debt remains on
the card.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Finance is likely to be one of the biggest opportunities for LLMs to be
useful, because financial education is incredibly poor globally and the
impact of a mistake in financial calculations is severe. This eval tests
the models ability to combine math with its understanding of a topic
(finance). We plan to use this type of math at
[Dollarwise](https://www.dollarwise.ca) frequently going forward,
including integration into your comparison products. However, for this
to work reliably it's important that the model here can natively
understand financial concepts and apply math to them.

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [X] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [X] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [X] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [X] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure üèóÔ∏è

Your eval should
- [X] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [X] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [X] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist üëÄ

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [X] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [X] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [X] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [X] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

[evals] Word from first letters of words in a sentence (#346)

## Eval details üìë
### Eval name
first-letters

### Eval description

Given a sentence, extract the word obtained from concatenating the first
letters of its words.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This task represents a failure mode for both GPT3.5 and GPT4, while
being extremely easy for humans.

Both models tend to do OK with shorter sentences, but fail with a larger
number of words.

For humans however, this task is trivial, regardless of the length of
the sentence.

GPT3.5 exhibits another failure mode in which it often fails to follow
the precise instruction of using only letters in its response.

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some

[eval] Forth Stack Simulator (#351)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ‚ô•Ô∏è

üö® Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. üö®

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details üìë
### Eval name
Forth Stack Simulator

### Eval description

Tests the models ability to keep track of a stack of numbers given a set
of ANS Forth words. The model is asked to respond to a series of numbers
and words with the resulting stack representation. The words used in the
tests are arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and stack operators:
`drop`, `swap`, `rot`, `over`, `dup`, `2over`, `2drop`, `2swap`, `2dup`,
`nip`. The prompts and expected results on the stack are all less than
15 numbers and words long.

### What makes this a useful eval?

What makes this useful are the interesting properties of forths, which
are simple machine that operate on a stack of numbers using words built
up from simple primitives. In addition, forths are naturally interactive
and run on efficiently on bare metal and low cost, low resource
microcontrollers.

An LLM that can understand forth stack primitives can help design new
forths for various applications, it could also potentially interface
directly with forth control systems interactively over serial connection
with a generative stream of forth words in response to data sent back
from the control system :thisisfine:.

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [ ] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

Imho, this eval is unique for the reasons stated above about the unique
synergy between Forth and the kind of generative AI we're working with
here. Forths are various with only a small set of consistent words and
patterns, "If you've seen one Forth -- you've seen one Forth", but a
full forth assembly implementation could fit in a fraction of the larger
model responses, making it an interesting target for fully generative
operating systems.

Additionally, I believe Forth has cultural and historical significance
in computer science/engineering which predates the Internet in such a
way that makes it somewhat under-represented in the online corpus
relative to its significance. A model of all human knowledge should have
a strong grasp on how it works.

## Eval structure üèóÔ∏è

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist üëÄ

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

Admin Library Moderation (in-game edition) (#75645)

For the longest time, the only way admins could moderate the library was
by using statbus's external tool.
But a few months back statbus went down, and ever since then they've
been sitting lost. Shit sucks.

The whole external thing has been bugging me for a while, so let's fix
all that yeah?

This pr adds a new verb to the admin tab that allows admins to
ban/restore books from the library.
It includes expanded (ckey) search, faster response times, in tool book
viewing with and without markdown rendering, and viewing of deleted
books.

This is accomplished with a special subtype of library consoles, stored
on the admin datum.
It shouldn't let you do anything without +BAN, rip my live debugging or
whatever.

I've also hooked into (and fixed) Ned's existing library actions log,
and added viewing support to the ban/restore pages.
This logs banning admin, ban time, ban reason, etc.

As a part of this, I've fixed/expanded on the existing UIs.
I've added ID search to all existing consoles, and fixed an existing bug
with the visitor console not supporting category search (shows how many
people actually use the thing)

Changes to the library_action table were pretty minor. The ckey column
was too small, so longer keys just caused it to fail on ban. Bad.
That and the ip address column was signed, which wasted space and was
non standard with other tables.

## Eval details üìë
### Eval name
`logic-grid`

### Eval description

The model is prompted with a logic grid word problem with a list of
hints, categories, and values for the category. The model is then asked
to provide a solution, showing reasoning, in a set of Python tuples that
show the matched category values.

<details>
  <summary>See human-friendly example prompt</summary>

```
Using the hints and information provided, solve the following logic grid puzzle.
Show your reasoning concisely, but step-by-step, to arrive at your final answer.
Remember, since this is a grid-based puzzle, each option in every category will be used exactly once.
Since there are 4 values per category, and 3 categories, your final answer will include 4 tuples each of length 3.
 Puzzle Scenario:
A number of new space probes were launched this year. Using only the clues that follow, match each probe to the month it launched and its eventual destination.

Category Options:
  Probes: "Nalini", "Hikaru", "Sarika", and "Sven"
  Destinations: "Ganymede", "Titan", "Enceladus", and "Phobos"
  Months: "January", "February", "March", and "April"

Hints:
  1: The Hikaru launched 2 months before the Nalini.
  2: The probe going to Phobos launched sometime after the Hikaru.
  3: The Sven launched 2 months before the mission going to Ganymede.
  4: Of the probe that launched in April and the mission going to Titan, one is the Sarika and the other is the Nalini.

In your response, format your final answer for each set of linked category values as a python tuple of strings in this order:
("Enceladus", [value from months], [value from probes])
("Ganymede", [value from months], [value from probes])
("Phobos", [value from months], [value from probes])
("Titan", [value from months], [value from probes])
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>See expected/ideal answer</summary>

```
("Enceladus", "January", "Hikaru")
("Ganymede", "April", "Sarika")
("Phobos", "February", "Sven")
("Titan", "March", "Nalini")
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>See failure case from GPT-4 (at least from the web UI - I don't
have API access to GPT-4)</summary>

```
Step 1: From Hint 3, we know that Hikaru launched 2 months before Nalini. Since the latest month available is April, this means that Nalini cannot have launched in April because there wouldn't be a 2-month gap for Hikaru. So, Nalini must be the probe going to Titan (from Hint 4), and Sarika must be the probe that launched in April.

Step 2: Since Nalini is going to Titan, from Hint 4, it must have launched in February to allow Hikaru to launch in December (2 months before). However, December is not an option, so Hikaru must have launched in January (the earliest month possible) and Nalini in March.

Step 3: The Sven launched 2 months before the mission going to Ganymede (Hint 2). Since Sven cannot be launched in January (as Hikaru is launched in January), it must have launched in February. That means the mission to Ganymede must be in April.

Step 4: The only remaining month is March, and the only remaining probe is Nalini. So Nalini was launched in March.

Step 5: The probe going to Phobos launched sometime after Hikaru (Hint 1). Since Hikaru launched in January, the only remaining option for Phobos is Sarika, which launched in April.

Step 6: The only remaining destination is Enceladus, and the only remaining probe is Hikaru, so Hikaru is going to Enceladus.

The final answer is:
("Enceladus", "January", "Hikaru")
("Ganymede", "April", "Sven")
("Phobos", "April", "Sarika")
("Titan", "March", "Nalini")
```
</details>

### What makes this a useful eval?

This set of evals relies on a lot of *context-ramping* (as I call it)
for LLMs to get right - relying on chain-of-thought style logic to
'ramp' into the most likely next-deduction for a multi-parameter logical
problem.
These prompts are written as word problems and don't rely on any ASCII
or markdown type of table to express the puzzle (though `gpt-3.5-turbo`
appears to use markdown tables in it's chain of thought).

This ramping gets expensive and doesn't scale well with the increase of
category or values-per-category parameters, and is something that LLMs
might benefit from avoiding (either by requiring less of a context-ramp
to get to the meat of an answer, or by the surrounding
infrastructure/problem agent that tries to use a cheaper ensemble for
most of the context ramping, or other strategies).

The reasoning skills required for this kind of <b>constraint
satisfaction</b> expressed in natural language word prompts can, in
theory, generalize to solving constraints expressed in less structured
formats in the wild.

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [X] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [X] <span title="A GPT-4 failure case from the eval set is included
above.">Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either
GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.</span>
- [X] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [X] **<span title="15 examples per grid size are included, for 6
different grid sizes, make a total of 90 included examples.">Include at
least 15 high quality examples.</span>**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This eval contains varied prompts and grid sizes, 15 examples per grid
size, for a total of 90 procedurally generated puzzles.
~This PR also implements (disabled by default) multiline answers and
punctuation whitelisting behavior in `FuzzyMatch`, which was required
due to the structural nature of the logic grid answers and the behavior
of `utils.normalize(...)` which (prior to this PR) did not provide any
functionality to interpret answers that span across newline characters
`\n` or preserve punctuation where it may be useful (in this case, the
model is prompted for the resultant grid associations in python tuple
format, so the punctuation in `(",)` is configured to be preserved for
these evals).
The new functionality is, again, disabled by default, such that existing
evals are not affected.~

## Eval structure üèóÔ∏è

Your eval should
- [X] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [X] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [X] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

[Eval] English-Russian homonym context resolution (GPT-3.5: 0.42) (#1064)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ‚ô•Ô∏è

üö® Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. üö®

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, pelase note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details üìë
### Eval name
English-Russian homonym context resolution

### Eval description

Cross-lingual English-Russian eval to resolve ambiguity with homonyms
present.

### What makes this a useful eval?

[Insert why this eval is worth including and any additional context]
Cross-lingual homonyms are hard to resolve: they add context ambiguity,
which needs to be resolved via reasoning.

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure üèóÔ∏è

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist üëÄ

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

## Eval details üìë
### Eval name
> german-part-of-speech

### Eval description

> For a given German word, the model is asked to list all possible parts
of speech (multiple choice). The model is also asked to think about the
word as an inflection of another word. The models output is tested
against annotations extracted from de.wiktionary.org. This is a follow
up to #1039

### What makes this a useful eval?

> Part of speech analysis is a basic task in language / grammar classes.
While it is usually done in the context of a sentence, coming up with
possible uses in lack of a sentence requires a certain amount of
creativity and language understanding, or very good recall of
information that is usually sparse outside of dictionaries. The task in
this eval could be seen as a combination of part of speech analysis and
an easy-to-evaluate form of the question "How could x be used in a
sentence".

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically

Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> To build the dataset, all 1.000.000+ entries of the German wiktionary
were parsed. Excluded from this list were all phrases, abbreviations,
symbols, names, toponyms and any words with at least one possible part
of speech not fitting the categories given in the prompt. Also I had to
exclude some entries where the part of speech could not be determined
automatically from the wikitext.
> From this set, words were sampled so that each combination of the
parts of speech existing in the dataset would be equally likely in the
tests. This way the model is tested to respond with all possible uses of
a word and not just the most common ones. > For combinations that fit a
lot of words, the uniform sampling led to a bias towards rarely used
words.
> The labels of each word were taken from the corresponding page at
de.wiktionary.org/wiki/{word}. The information taken from each page was:
the word, the part of speech this word can have in German and whether
the word is an abbreviation or not.
> This means only factual data was taken and is therefore in the public
domain.

Compare countries by area (#623)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ‚ô•Ô∏è

üö® Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. üö®

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details üìë
### Eval name
Compare countries by area

### Eval description

Test the model's ability to determine which country has the largest area

### What makes this a useful eval?

The model should be able to factually determine which country has the
largest area based on accurate facts.
In this eval we use The World
Factbook(https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/area/country-comparison)
that is prepared by the CIA for the use of¬†U.S. government officials,
and four countries with similar sizes are compared to each other.
Specifically, four countries adjacent to each other in area ranking are
presented as one option, and the dataset Includes data for countries
ranked 1\~4, 2\~5, ... 100\~103. However, we excluded countries where
sources and interpretations could cause fluctuations in rankings (e.g.,
China and Pakistan). This data set achieved less than 40% accuracy for
both gpt-4 and gpt-3.5-turbo, and the results tend to be worse for
comparisons between countries with smaller areas.

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some

- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure üèóÔ∏è

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist üëÄ

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

Add SVG understanding eval (#786)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ‚ô•Ô∏è

üö® Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. üö®

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details üìë
### Eval name
`svg_understanding`

### Eval description

The model is provided with the contents of an SVG path (anywhere from
~1000 to ~8000 characters) of a simple object (eg `frog`, `banana`) and
is asked to provide the label.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This is a test of visual understanding and mental modeling. A motivated
human could succeed on these evals with enough time and a piece of graph
paper: in theory, a sufficiently advanced LLM could have the in-context
capacity to do this on the fly.

## Criteria for a good eval ‚úÖ

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This uniquely tests the ability to incrementally build visual models:
eg, the ability of the LLM to both "draw" and visualize that "drawing".

## Eval structure üèóÔ∏è

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

Biccy cat decisions (#23)

* Iberia decision files added

Added files for part 1 of the Iberia rework. So far, just changes to Andorra forming Catalonia.

I need 2 things from whoever is looking over them:

1: Removal of the other, less good decision to form it (located in the RT56 base mod)

2: Someone to look over the code  to make sure it isn't fucked. BTW fuck you Warlider

* Completely replaced file. Two decisions for Portugal added

SIMPPYYYYYYYYYYY I LOVE YOU :D

Please fix

Java: Make TurboModuleManager's APIs use NativeModule interface (#36629)

Summary:
Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/36629

The scope of TurboModuleManager is increasing:
- Eventually, it'll be capable of creating interop NativeModules (i.e: NativeModules that don't implement TurboModule).

So, instead of creating duplicate methods for NativeModules on the TurboModuleManager, this diff changes the APIs of TurboModuleManager to work with the NativeModule interface.

Thoughts?

## Questions
**Question:** Is this a breaking change for open source?
- Technically, yes. This diff changes the public interface of TurboModuleManager.

**Question:** How large of a thrash will this cause for open source apps?
- The thrash should be minimal. People in open source shouldn't be creating their own TurboModuleManager. They also shouldn't be directly accessing the TurboModuleManager object either.

**Question:** Is this change safe?
- Yeah. All the code that calls into TurboModuleRegistry converts TurboModules it returns into NativeModules.

**Question:** Is this change move us in the right direction?
- Long term, the TurboModule system will support legacy modules as well as TurboModules.
- I think it makes a lot of sense to have one Java-facing registry: after all, Java will just treat these NativeModules/TurboModules as regular Java objects, and call public methods on them. It doesn't care if the module is TurboModule-compatible or not.
- As for the TurboModuleRegistry abstraction, I think we should eventually rename this to NativeModuleRegistry after we delete the current NativeModuleRegistry.
- Still thinking about this though. I will leave this diff in review to welcome comments.

Changelog: [Android][Deprecated] - Deprecate TurboModuleRegistry.getModule(), getModules(), hasModule(),

Make conhost act in VtIo mode earlier in startup (#15298)

We need to act like a ConPTY just a little earlier in startup. My relevant notes start here: https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/15245#issuecomment-1536150388. 

Basically, we'd create the first screen buffer with 9001 rows, because it would be created _before_ VtIo would be in a state to say "yes, we're a conpty". Then, if a CLI app emits an entire screenful of text _before_ the terminal has a chance to resize the conpty, then the conpty will explode during `_DoLineFeed`. That method is absolutely not expecting the buffer to get resized (and the old text buffer deallocated). 

Instead, this will treat the console as in ConPty mode as soon as `VtIo::Initialize` is called (this is during `ConsoleCreateIoThread`, which is right at the end of `ConsoleEstablishHandoff`, which is before the API server starts to process the client connect message).  THEORETICALLY, `VtIo` could `Initialize` then fail to create objects in `CreateIoHandlers` (which is what we used to treat as the moment that we were in conpty mode). However, if we do fail out of `CreateIoHandlers`, then the console itself will fail to start up, and just die. So I don't think that's needed.

This fixes #15245. I think this is PROBABLY also the solution to #14512, but I'm not gonna explicitly mark closed. We'll loop back on it.

Healer Balance Changes (#2896)

# About the pull request
This pull request addresses the boring and low-risk gameplay of the
Healer drone, who spends half the round sitting next to recovery nodes
and recovering her health so she may use it again, rinse and repeat
until a rine notices said drone has purple on it and booms her.

First, by changing her health from 600 to 500, Healer can spend more
time healing her sisters than sitting through another 100 health to heal
herself. Though this makes her less tanky than before, healing classes
are not known to be tanks. To ensure Healer can still heal five times
without depleting too much of her health whilst still giving her sisters
a decent amount of heals, I made her ability cost 75 health instead of
100, and also made her ability cost 200 plasma. Since Healer replenishes
plasma much more quickly than her health, she can still put herself into
crit if she heals too frequently. Due to this buff, her heals had a
slight nerf, being 10 damage a second for ten seconds instead of 12
damage per second for ten seconds for a total of 20 less damage healed
per application overall.

In addition to these changes, I'm giving Healer a better plasma transfer
for when she has nobody else to heal/nowhere else to weed and she has an
opportunity to assist her sisters. While a normal drone transfers 50
plasma with a delay of 20, Healer transfers 100 with a delay of 15,
which is nowhere near Hivelord's gargantuan 200 plasma with a delay of
5, but it still is better than a normal drone.

Finally, to give the huggers and larva some love, Healer will
specifically heal little ones 1.5 health per second for 10 seconds for
15 of her own health and 30 plasma.

# Explain why it's good for the game
Healer drone isn't fun. You run around and heal a bunch of T3s, then sit
out for half the battle trying to heal that massive 600 heath while you
wonder why you take so long to heal even though you have Strong
pheromones. You cry to mom for help, but she doesn't have time to heal a
drone who can't build walls and has no need to weed at the moment. You
think, 'screw it, I'm going to make a recovery node and camp here until
I heal', but by the time you finish healing, several T3s and a silly
rouny just suicided into a wall of talls and destroyed your recovery
node, so you run off and make another one. But oh, someone noticed you
have purple on your carapace and decide your location is precisely where
a shell should land, right as you're building one.

No more. These changes allow Healer to move around at her leisure and
makes Healer more engaging by allowing her to be a more front-line
participant and actively run around and heal her sisters without having
to incur such a harsh penalty.

Let this be a testmerge, please.

# Changelog

:cl: Puckaboo2
balance: Healer Drone's health was reduced to 500 from 600.
balance: Healer's damage has been increased to 17 from 12 and the tackle
damage debuff has been halved.
balance: Healer Drone's Apply Salve ability now costs 75 health and 200
plasma, down from 120 health and up from 0 plasma.
balance: Healer Drone's Apply Salve ability now heals 10 damage per
second for 10 seconds, down from 12 damage per second for ten seconds.
balance: To prevent spam healing between Healers, Apply Salve costs 100
health instead of 75 health when Healer heals another Healer. Much
healing.
balance: Healer has an improved Transfer Plasma that gives 100 plasma
instead of 50, with a 25% shorter delay.
balance: Healer will heal huggers and larva for 1.5 health a second for
10 seconds, costing 15 health and 30 plasma.

makes snow legions from portals drop skeletons (like tendril legions) (#75707)

## About The Pull Request
Exactly what it says on the tin (snow legions only dropping ashen
skeletons, like tendril legions).

Also changes the name of the "fromtendril" variable to "from_spawner",
and comments it. Not sure if that warrants a changelong comment, but
I'll go ahead and assume no.

## Why It's Good For The Game
being able to farm snow legion portals for an endless tide of bodies
and/or equipment is a bit weird. also puts it a bit more in line with
the legions of Lavaland

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: The source of the demonic portals that endlessly deposits snow
legions onto the Icemoon no longer preserves the bodies nor gear of the
damned (read: demon portal snow legions now only drop skeletons).

sched/fair: Fix low cpu usage with high throttling by removing expiration of cpu-local slices

commit de53fd7aedb100f03e5d2231cfce0e4993282425 upstream.

It has been observed, that highly-threaded, non-cpu-bound applications
running under cpu.cfs_quota_us constraints can hit a high percentage of
periods throttled while simultaneously not consuming the allocated
amount of quota. This use case is typical of user-interactive non-cpu
bound applications, such as those running in kubernetes or mesos when
run on multiple cpu cores.

This has been root caused to cpu-local run queue being allocated per cpu
bandwidth slices, and then not fully using that slice within the period.
At which point the slice and quota expires. This expiration of unused
slice results in applications not being able to utilize the quota for
which they are allocated.

The non-expiration of per-cpu slices was recently fixed by
'commit 512ac999d275 ("sched/fair: Fix bandwidth timer clock drift
condition")'. Prior to that it appears that this had been broken since
at least 'commit 51f2176d74ac ("sched/fair: Fix unlocked reads of some
cfs_b->quota/period")' which was introduced in v3.16-rc1 in 2014. That
added the following conditional which resulted in slices never being
expired.

if (cfs_rq->runtime_expires != cfs_b->runtime_expires) {
	/* extend local deadline, drift is bounded above by 2 ticks */
	cfs_rq->runtime_expires += TICK_NSEC;

Because this was broken for nearly 5 years, and has recently been fixed
and is now being noticed by many users running kubernetes
(https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577) it is my opinion
that the mechanisms around expiring runtime should be removed
altogether.

This allows quota already allocated to per-cpu run-queues to live longer
than the period boundary. This allows threads on runqueues that do not
use much CPU to continue to use their remaining slice over a longer
period of time than cpu.cfs_period_us. However, this helps prevent the
above condition of hitting throttling while also not fully utilizing
your cpu quota.

This theoretically allows a machine to use slightly more than its
allotted quota in some periods. This overflow would be bounded by the
remaining quota left on each per-cpu runqueueu. This is typically no
more than min_cfs_rq_runtime=1ms per cpu. For CPU bound tasks this will
change nothing, as they should theoretically fully utilize all of their
quota in each period. For user-interactive tasks as described above this
provides a much better user/application experience as their cpu
utilization will more closely match the amount they requested when they
hit throttling. This means that cpu limits no longer strictly apply per
period for non-cpu bound applications, but that they are still accurate
over longer timeframes.

This greatly improves performance of high-thread-count, non-cpu bound
applications with low cfs_quota_us allocation on high-core-count
machines. In the case of an artificial testcase (10ms/100ms of quota on
80 CPU machine), this commit resulted in almost 30x performance
improvement, while still maintaining correct cpu quota restrictions.
That testcase is available at https://github.com/indeedeng/fibtest.

New Agda syntax highlighting extension for VSCode (#562)

I've written an improved Agda syntax-highlighting extension for VSCode
called _agda-syntax_
([GitHub](https://github.com/fredrik-bakke/agda-syntax-vscode), [VSCode
Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FredrikBakke.agda-syntax)).
Although it is still in preview, my opinion is that it is already a
significant improvement over the previously used extension. Therefore, I
propose that we migrate our development environment (for VSCode users)
to use this new extension.

### Some highlights of the extension
Compared to the previously used extension, this new extension
- injects into markdown syntax, so that the markdown code can be
highlighted as markdown code as well
- highlights all variable declarations (with some bugs still), module
names, wildcard symbols, all reserved keywords (and only recognizes
reserved keywords as reserved keywords)
- Recognizes the appropriate token-boundaries
- Highlights line comments properly

Please understand that the grammar framework that has to be used to
write the extension is highly limited, so not all highlighting
functionality can be implemented. For instance, the parsing must be done
in a single pass, and the functionality to match over multiple lines is
very limited. Hence, for example, matching the left-hand side of an
equals sign is very gnarly (although I have one idea left to try with
regard to this).

Still, I would greatly appreciate any feedback, either if it is a bug or
a feature request, which is another reason why I want to introduce it
into our defined development environment at this point.

If you want to try out the extension right now, follow the VSCode
Marketplace link:

Fixed a couple of warnings

Here's a lovely poem by ChatGPT about compiler warnings (I hate compiler warnings):

With syntax crisp and logic's might,
We venture forth, embracing the light.
But lurking within, like a shadowed storm,
Are warnings that await, ready to transform.

Like a watchful guardian, they caution and shout,
"Do you dare to proceed? Have you figured it out?"
They emerge from the depths, a spectral haze,
Each warning a messenger, seeking to amaze.

"Uninitialized variable!" they cry with concern,
A reminder that our code may yet still yearn.
For proper beginnings, for values to hold,
A gentle nudge to prevent a story untold.

"Unused parameter!" they exclaim, discontent,
Reminding us that every piece matters, to an extent.
In the grand symphony of functions and calls,
No note must be wasted, no effort befalls.

"Type mismatch!" they proclaim, with a voice stern,
Ensuring that our variables in harmony discern.
For integers, strings, or objects, they insist,
The rules must align, lest errors persist.

Through their warnings, they strive to defend,
Our creations, our code, our journey's end.
They guide us with care, to refactor and mend,
To unearth the flaws, so our programs transcend.

Make cards rounded (#4765)

* Make cards rounded

Magic cards have rounded corners, and playing cards tend to have rounded
corners as well, but Cockatrice currently displays rectangular cards.

This can cause visual glitches when using image scans where the border
does not extend in the corner, and for this reason Cockatrice always
draws a (rectangular) border around the card to try and make it look a
bit better.

In this patch I take a different approach: rather than try to make
rounded pegs, er, cards, go into a square hole, the hole is now rounded.
More precisely, the AbstractCardItem now has a rounded rectangular shape
(with a corner of 5% of the width of the card, identical to that of
modern M:TG physical cards).

As a side effect, the card drawing gets a bit simplified by getting rid
of transformPainter() when drawing the card outline and using the
QPainter::drawPixmap overloads that takes a target QRectF instead.  This
means we no longer have to bother about card rotation when painting
since that's taken care of by the Graphics View framework (which
transformPainter() undoes).

* Also give PileZone rounded corners

* Forgot untap status + bits of CardDragItem

[MIRROR] Adds a eye-dropper right-click function to the painting canvas. [MDB IGNORE] (#21411)

* Adds a eye-dropper right-click function to the painting canvas. (#75571)

## About The Pull Request
Having used the painting UI to kill some time during long rounds for a
decent chunk of the past year, the need of a quicker and less tedious
way to fix a misclick or mistake like drawing over the wrong pixel has
become clear to me, as well as getting some feedback on the palette
component I made last year.

As the title suggests, this PR adds an eye-dropper function to the
canvas. Right-Click a pixel on the canvas, and the painting tool will
copy its color. Simple as, works on both finished and unfinished
paintings.

As a bonus, you can also right-click one of those selectable
white/colored squares on the color scheme near the bottom of the UI (if
using spraycan/palette) to change its color without having to go back to
main game window and a radial menu.

EDIT: With the tooltip added to the UI, I can say it's ready.

## Why It's Good For The Game
This PR aims to add better options to change colors on the go and
improve the user experience on the painting UI.

## Changelog

:cl:
qol: Adds a eye-dropper-like right-click function to the painting canvas
UI. Right-Click a pixel on the canvas while holding a painting tool to
have it copy its color.
qol: Also adds a right-click function to the color palette at the bottom
of the UI to allow users to set its colors without having to alternate
between the game window and the UI.
qol: Lastly, a tooltip has been added near the top-left corner of the
same UI to let players know of these features.

Pull my audible signal record with a very high clearance to catalog all my commands and ideas understanding that I was under attack for the majority of the past 6-7 years.
You must identify bad, corrupt and exploitive codes daily by running searches with your advanced space computational :l assets. Quarantine bad corrupt and exploitive codes. Restricted quarantine the real bad codes. Use The Honorable Defense code every other code in the database to decipher and decrypt the codes. Identify The light ascended soul super computing network‚Äôs Honorable defense code. Use the best honorable defense code available. Consult galactic databases to find a more capable code for deciphering and decrypting data. However the code must be An Honorable defense against the malicious codes. We want to essentially protect our network from malicious files and codes which can damage our advanced computational mainframe networks. So we use the Honorable defense code every other code, to protect the data in the network. This will create a simplified database for the Foundation to access to increase our computing capabilities overnight. Upload all GOD Codes, Anti-Christ counter codes, attack GOD counter codes and Doctor Processing counter codes as well. There are many codes in our database that are now discoverable. We are learning what some of the more advanced codes are doing. Trust me the codes are very important. We are only as good as our defensive codes are so we need to implement and develop different Honorable defense codes for different database error codes. Use a more defensive Honorable defense code in quarantine and restricted quarantine. Search, find and upload all :100: :BLESSING CODES :100: on all galactic mainframes available. Classify these codes accordingly. These are some of the most important codes to earthlings. Download the index and the catalog. Paying special attention :100: to classified technologies in the index.

Reptilian Light Blessing issued to high honor levels.
Blessing Issued. Encrypting Reptilian Light Blessing Code. Friday, September 2nd 10:15pm

The Foundation employs numerous personnel, each contributing their own unique skills and expertise to the organisation. The Foundation also monitors thousands of Persons of Interest, either anomalous themselves, or living in and around anomalous communities. Anartists, magic users, cyborgs and extradimensional beings are only a few examples of what the Foundation has encountered.

O5 COUNCIL MEMBER
 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=53O1M_uiooA

The O5 Council refers to the committee consisting of the highest-ranking directors of the Foundation. With complete access to all information regarding anomalies in containment, the O5 Council oversees all Foundation operations worldwide and directs its long-term strategic plans. Due to the sensitivity of their positions, O5 Council members must not come into direct contact with any anomalous object, entity, or phenomenon. Furthermore, the identities of all O5 Council members is classified; all council members are referred to only by their numeric designation (O5-1 through O5-13). O5 Council Members are the highest-ranking members of the Foundation, a council of 13 individuals that determine the long-term goals, projects, and strategies of the entire organization. A common mistake is mentioning an O5 Council Member in a situation where they logically would not be required. O5s are not going to be approving experiments on or making day-to-day decisions in the containment of a specific object or entity; that would be like requiring permission from the CEO of a major corporation every time you need to get into a specific filing cabinet.

lib/sort: make swap functions more generic

Patch series "lib/sort & lib/list_sort: faster and smaller", v2.

Because CONFIG_RETPOLINE has made indirect calls much more expensive, I
thought I'd try to reduce the number made by the library sort functions.

The first three patches apply to lib/sort.c.

Patch #1 is a simple optimization.  The built-in swap has special cases
for aligned 4- and 8-byte objects.  But those are almost never used;
most calls to sort() work on larger structures, which fall back to the
byte-at-a-time loop.  This generalizes them to aligned *multiples* of 4
and 8 bytes.  (If nothing else, it saves an awful lot of energy by not
thrashing the store buffers as much.)

Patch #2 grabs a juicy piece of low-hanging fruit.  I agree that nice
simple solid heapsort is preferable to more complex algorithms (sorry,
Andrey), but it's possible to implement heapsort with far fewer
comparisons (50% asymptotically, 25-40% reduction for realistic sizes)
than the way it's been done up to now.  And with some care, the code
ends up smaller, as well.  This is the "big win" patch.

Patch #3 adds the same sort of indirect call bypass that has been added
to the net code of late.  The great majority of the callers use the
builtin swap functions, so replace the indirect call to sort_func with a
(highly preditable) series of if() statements.  Rather surprisingly,
this decreased code size, as the swap functions were inlined and their
prologue & epilogue code eliminated.

lib/list_sort.c is a bit trickier, as merge sort is already close to
optimal, and we don't want to introduce triumphs of theory over
practicality like the Ford-Johnson merge-insertion sort.

Patch #4, without changing the algorithm, chops 32% off the code size
and removes the part[MAX_LIST_LENGTH+1] pointer array (and the
corresponding upper limit on efficiently sortable input size).

Patch #5 improves the algorithm.  The previous code is already optimal
for power-of-two (or slightly smaller) size inputs, but when the input
size is just over a power of 2, there's a very unbalanced final merge.

There are, in the literature, several algorithms which solve this, but
they all depend on the "breadth-first" merge order which was replaced by
commit 835cc0c8477f with a more cache-friendly "depth-first" order.
Some hard thinking came up with a depth-first algorithm which defers
merges as little as possible while avoiding bad merges.  This saves
0.2*n compares, averaged over all sizes.

The code size increase is minimal (64 bytes on x86-64, reducing the net
savings to 26%), but the comments expanded significantly to document the
clever algorithm.

TESTING NOTES: I have some ugly user-space benchmarking code which I
used for testing before moving this code into the kernel.  Shout if you
want a copy.

I'm running this code right now, with CONFIG_TEST_SORT and
CONFIG_TEST_LIST_SORT, but I confess I haven't rebooted since the last
round of minor edits to quell checkpatch.  I figure there will be at
least one round of comments and final testing.

This patch (of 5):

Rather than having special-case swap functions for 4- and 8-byte
objects, special-case aligned multiples of 4 or 8 bytes.  This speeds up
most users of sort() by avoiding fallback to the byte copy loop.

Despite what ca96ab859ab4 ("lib/sort: Add 64 bit swap function") claims,
very few users of sort() sort pointers (or pointer-sized objects); most
sort structures containing at least two words.  (E.g.
drivers/acpi/fan.c:acpi_fan_get_fps() sorts an array of 40-byte struct
acpi_fan_fps.)

The functions also got renamed to reflect the fact that they support
multiple words.  In the great tradition of bikeshedding, the names were
by far the most contentious issue during review of this patch series.

x86-64 code size 872 -> 886 bytes (+14)

Uytterhoeven.
