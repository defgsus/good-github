FOV is Dead (Long Live FOV) (#80062)

## About The Pull Request

FOV as it is currently implemented is incompatible* with wallening.
I'm doin wallening, so we gotta redo things here.

The issue is the masking of mobs. Wallening relies on sidemap (layering
based off physical position), which only works on things on the same
plane (because planes are basically sheets we render down onto)
So rather then masking mobs, let's reuse the masking idea from old fov,
and use it to cut out a bit of the game render plane, and
blur/over-saturate the bit that's masked out.

My hope is this makes things visible in light, but not as much in
darkness, alongside making more vivid shit more easily seen (just like
real life)

Here's some videos, what follows after is the commits I care about
(since I had to rip a bunch of planes to nothing, so the files changed
tab might be a bit of a mess)

Oh also I had to remove the darkness pref since the darkness is doing a
lot of the heavy lifting now. I'm sorry.

Edit:
NEW FOV SPRITES! Thanks dongle your aviator glasses will guide us to a
better future.

## Commits I Care About

[Implements something like fov, but without the planes as layers
hell](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/a604c7b1c8d74cd27af4d806d85892c1f7e35ba8)

Rather then masking out mobs standing behind us, we use a combo color
matrix and blur filter to make the stuff covered by fov harder to see.

We achive this by splitting the game plane into two, masking both by fov
(one normally and one inversely), and then applying effects to one of
the two.

I want to make the fov fullscreens more gradient, but as an effect this
is a good start

[Removes WALL_PLANE_UPPER by adding a WALL_PLANE overlay to material
walls (init cost comes
here)](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/25489337392f708cb337fbf05a2329eacdfc5346)

@Mothblocks see this. comment in commit explains further but uh, we need
to draw material walls to the light mask plane so things actually can be
seen on them, but we can't do that and also have them be big, so they
get an overlay. Sorry, slight init time bump, about 0.5 seconds. I can
kill it with wallening.

[Moves SEETHROUGH_PLANE above
ABOVE_GAME_PLANE](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/beec4c00e01d34a04fba7c2bb98a9b70d27ead82)

I don't think it actually wants to draw here
@Time-Green I think this was you so pinging for opinion

[Resprites FOV masks to be clean (and more
consistent)](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/80062/commits/f02ad13696b3b17658af612c62848b48609d785d)

This is 100% donglesplonge's work, he's spent a week or so going back
and forth with me sharpening these to a mirror shine, real chill

## Why It's Good For The Game

Walls are closing in

## Changelog
:cl: LemonInTheDark, Donglesplonge
image: Redoes fov "mask" sprites. They're clean, have a very pleasant
dithering effect, and look real fuckin good!
del: Changed FOV, it no longer hides mobs, instead it blurs the hidden
area, and makes it a bit darker/oversaturated

Big Customisation Update (#339)

## About The Pull Request

![anyinterest](https://github.com/f13babylon/f13babylon/assets/132588088/ea961bfc-390f-42ec-83ea-0fe69d48bb86)

Adds in 269 new customisation parts. Many were ported and some were
already in our codebase one way or another.

A few existing broken parts (no sprite and I can't find one anywhere)
were removed. There was also an effort to alphabetise the part lists
more, sort out the dmis (mam_markings.dmi is looking really neat now,
check it out) and integrate modularised content (goodbye citadel
snowflake.dm)

Also, species that were allowed hair but not facial hair were lifted
from this restriction. (This is anthromorphs, synthetic anthromorphs,
and synthetic lizardpeople.) This is especially useful for the new horn
and tongue parts they have.

This was not a straight port - it took a while and I playtested it a
bunch. But please please test merge first, there is a lot.

Meat Hook Rework (Accidental Features) (#80002)

## About The Pull Request

Or, how I tried to kill `/datum/forced_movement` but got absolutely
clonged.

Actually, I did kill `/datum/forced_movement`. It was only used in one
spot so I just went ahead and cooked it into a special utility datum
that should only be used in one spot. We can optimize the code later or
something, but I like the way it is right now (pretty much status quo
without the potential of someone using a depreciated framework).

Alright, there were also like 3 `TODO`s (4 if you count the move loop
comment (which is ehhhh)). I naively tried to tackle them a very hard
way, but then I just realized I could use the fancy new datum I cooked
up and wow they're all solved now. The hook looks so fucking good now.

* The code is overall more streamlined, with all of the post-projectile
work being handled by a special datum (I wanted it to be handled by the
hook but the timings were all based on SSFastprocess so datum it is).
Forced movement is killed but we just salvaged whatever we needed from
it.
* More traits to ensure we don't cheese in a way we're not supposed to
* A very sexy chain will spawn when you drag your kill in (this wasn't
there before but I fixeded it :3)
* The firer will actually get grounded when they try and shoot the chain
out. They get grounded for 0.25 seconds unless they hit something. I
don't know how the timing is but I think it's fair.
* We also add a unique suicide act, because I noticed we did the
"magical" one previously, which big-league sucked.
* More traits to ensure less cheese! I like how nice it is now.
## Why It's Good For The Game

The meat hook really makes you _feel_ like Roadhog from Overwatch.
Resolves a bunch of old TODOs while getting rid of a completely obsolete
framework in a really neat way. I don't typically like mixing balances
and refactors but these TODOs were getting crusty man i just wanted to
get them out of the way
## Changelog
:cl:
balance: The Meat Hook will now "ground" you whenever you fire it out at
someone. You get a very small immobilization every time you fire, which
"upgrades" to a full immobilization whenever you actually hit an atom
and start to drag it in.
fix: A chain should now show up as you drag in something with the meat
hooks.
fix: Meat hooks should no longer play the "magical gun" suicide if you
were to use it, but instead do their own unique thing.

Blood brothers is now a single person conversion antagonist (#79971)

## About The Pull Request
Instead of choosing 2-3 brothers, *one* person will be selected and
given a flash which can convert one other person over. In accordance to
the existing 10% chance for 3 members, there is a 10% chance that the
first person converted will receive a flash of their own.

Expectation is people will flash a friend or a robust guy or whatever.
My intent is primarily to see if this kind of blood brothers is more
enjoyable to play with/against, and if their inclusion in a round
increases the general chaos of it. My theory is that since most likely
blood brothers will be people who know each other, that it can become
more consistently interesting to the rest of the crew. That or they just
murderbone together idk

Fikou and head admins said they wanted this to replace rather than add
which I agree with.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Keeps the sandboxy aspect of blood brothers (no uplink) while likely
making it more enjoyable to play. Conversion is equally as simple as
revs for the user, and is just as intuitive to the one being converted
since there are no new mechanics thrown in your face.

Blood brothers is currently disabled everywhere on the main servers
except for MRP. I think this form will be more appealing to all
rulesets. If left enabled, Dynamic now has more antagonists to make
rounds diverse with and I want that

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Instead of teaming up random people together, blood brothers will
now start out with one player and let them convert a single other person
over to blood brother using a flash.

Vanguard tweaks (#5174)

# About the pull request
This catches up vanguard to current gameplay as it was last changed
approximately 4 years ago


# Explain why it's good for the game
Currently Vanguard is supposed to be a frontlining tier 3 who dashes in
> stays in and gets some damage in and goes out (thats why the shield is
a thing) and you're supposed to be able to stay there because your
abilities (pierce and dash) resets your shield. But with the recent
addition of just more damage in general be it m56d, full auto mode or
just the amnout of extra damage you can receive from the front compared
4 years ago.

The strain currently struggles and is near useless other then the
occasional go in and lucky fling.

I've changed up the dash to reset your shield once you hit ONE person,
rather then two so that you dont instantly die while going in, the
shield is very situational as it will most likely decay before you can
even go in.

Listening to people who play vanguard, i've also increased the root to
2.5 seconds (this is buffed so when the prae has the shield) the marine
can still shoot back when they're rooted so i dont think the duration is
a big problem (this is going to be a test merge so i will be watching)

# Testing Photographs and Procedure
it just works

</details>


# Changelog

:cl:
balance: Vanguard dash now restores your shield if you hit ANYONE
instead of 2 people.
balance: Vanguard buffed root now roots you for 2.5 seconds, unbuffed
for 1 second
qol: Vanguard's pierce has now a hit sound for better feedback

feat(sdk): inflights are not required to be resources (#4993)

## Huh?

The primary goal of this PR is to reduce the input required to create an inflight function in TS (See https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/4842) without necessarily overhauling the compiler (yet). Ideally, the minimum information required for an inflight is simply the code itself. However, because inflights are currently modeled as resources, they require a scope and id.

So the first change was to make a new non-resource interface, IInflight, encompassing the inflight contract. The most important part of this contract is that inflights must be liftable, a behavior currently unique to resources and certain other primitives. So I extracted the lift-related functions from IResource and slapped them on the new ILiftable (which both IInflight and IResource now extend).

But that created a new problem: lifting itself also currently requires a scope. The only usage of the scope was to be able to resolve tokens. This did not seem like a good enough reason to require scope, so I changed token resolution to be more of a global concern rather than a tree-level concern. This is dangerous, but it's mostly only dangerous when you try to deal with tokens in a multi-app scenario, which would be dangerous with our current approach anyways. So this is something we'll have to add some extra handling for eventually anyways.

## Results

The primary outcome of this can be seen in the SDK unit tests, where the `Testing.makeHandler()` now only requires the code and (optional) bindings. This is basically 1 or 2 steps away from an ideal TS experience.

## But wait nothing changed in winglang

The original purpose of representing inflights as resources was to ease the implementation of lifting in the compiler and generally unify the logic of inflights between inflight closures and inflight methods of preflight classes. This hasn't changed in this PR. Luckily, the class instance emitted by the wing compiler for inflights still satisfies IInflight. It just has some extra hidden resource stuff that is simply unused. Assuming this PR is wanted, I will do a followup to change the compiler as well. This will be a more complicated change and I think it's useful to basically get the backend working first.

## Changes

- `Testing.makeHandler` now takes only code text and bindings. 9 billion tests were updated for this contract. `convertBetweenHandlers` changed similarly
- TokenResolvers are now globally registered and not tied to specific apps
- wingc adds a _hash private field to inflight closure resource classes to match the new IInflight (just an md5 hash)
- Many of the resources that deduped functions based on `addr` now do so with `_hash` instead
- Removed many occurrences of `this.node.id` used in resource ids when it's not necessary. The only time this should be necessary is if the resources is being created in the scope of this.node.scope instead
- Added a `Counter` concept to help with the many places that we want to add a subresource many times and a simple incrementing number will suffice for uniqueness and clarity
  - This was needed because the inflight `addr` was often relied upon to make this unique, but that will no longer be viable. I think it's better this way anyways

experimental_use(promise) (#25084)

* Internal `act`: Unwrapping resolved promises

This update our internal implementation of `act` to support React's new
behavior for unwrapping promises. Like we did with Scheduler, when 
something suspends, it will yield to the main thread so the microtasks
can run, then continue in a new task.

I need to implement the same behavior in the public version of `act`,
but there are some additional considerations so I'll do that in a
separate commit.

* Move throwException to after work loop resumes

throwException is the function that finds the nearest boundary and
schedules it for a second render pass. We should only call it right 
before we unwind the stack — not if we receive an immediate ping and
render the fiber again.

This was an oversight in 8ef3a7c that I didn't notice because it happens
to mostly work, anyway. What made me notice the mistake is that
throwException also marks the entire render phase as suspended
(RootDidSuspend or RootDidSuspendWithDelay), which is only supposed to
be happen if we show a fallback. One consequence was that, in the 
RootDidSuspendWithDelay case, the entire commit phase was blocked,
because that's the exit status we use to block a bad fallback
from appearing.

* Use expando to check whether promise has resolved

Add a `status` expando to a thrown thenable to track when its value has
resolved.

In a later step, we'll also use `value` and `reason` expandos to track
the resolved value.

This is not part of the official JavaScript spec — think of
it as an extension of the Promise API, or a custom interface that is a
superset of Thenable. However, it's inspired by the terminology used
by `Promise.allSettled`.

The intent is that this will be a public API — Suspense implementations
can set these expandos to allow React to unwrap the value synchronously
without waiting a microtask.

* Scaffolding for `experimental_use` hook

Sets up a new experimental hook behind a feature flag, but does not
implement it yet.

* use(promise)

Adds experimental support to Fiber for unwrapping the value of a promise
inside a component. It is not yet implemented for Server Components, 
but that is planned.

If promise has already resolved, the value can be unwrapped
"immediately" without showing a fallback. The trick we use to implement
this is to yield to the main thread (literally suspending the work
loop), wait for the microtask queue to drain, then check if the promise
resolved in the meantime. If so, we can resume the last attempted fiber
without unwinding the stack. This functionality was implemented in 
previous commits.

Another feature is that the promises do not need to be cached between
attempts. Because we assume idempotent execution of components, React
will track the promises that were used during the previous attempt and
reuse the result. You shouldn't rely on this property, but during
initial render it mostly just works. Updates are trickier, though,
because if you used an uncached promise, we have no way of knowing 
whether the underlying data has changed, so we have to unwrap the
promise every time. It will still work, but it's inefficient and can
lead to unnecessary fallbacks if it happens during a discrete update.

When we implement this for Server Components, this will be less of an
issue because there are no updates in that environment. However, it's
still better for performance to cache data requests, so the same
principles largely apply.

The intention is that this will eventually be the only supported way to
suspend on arbitrary promises. Throwing a promise directly will
be deprecated.

Merge #113809

113809: kvstreamer: add limit to how many eager batches are issued r=yuzefovich a=yuzefovich

**kvstreamer: add limit to how many eager batches are issued**

This commit fixes extremely suboptimal behavior of the streamer in the
InOrder mode in some cases. In particular, previously it was possible
for the buffered responses to consume most of the working budget, so the
streamer would degrade to processing all requests effectively one
BatchRequest with one Get / Scan at a time, significantly increasing the
latency. For example, the query added as a regression test that performs
30k Gets across 10 ranges would usually take on the order of 1.5s (which
is not great already since in the non-streamer path it takes 400ms), but
in the degenerate cases it could be on the order of 20-30s.

Similar behavior could occur in the OutOfOrder mode too where we would
issue more BatchRequests in which only one request could be satisfied
(although in OutOfOrder mode the problem is not as severe - we don't
buffer any results since we can always return them right away).

This problem is now fixed by imposing the limit on the budget's usage at
which point the streamer stops issuing "eager" requests. Namely, now,
when there is at least one request in flight, the streamer won't issue
anymore requests once `limit * eagerFraction` is exceeded. This
effectively reserves a portion of the budget for the "head-of-the-line"
batch.

The "eager fraction" is controlled by a session variable, separate for
each mode. The defaults of 0.5 for InOrder and 0.8 for OutOfOrder modes
were chosen after running TPCH queries and the query that inspired this
commit. These values bring the number of gRPC calls for the reproduction
query from 1.5k-2k range to below 200 and the query latency to be
reliably around 400ms.

I don't really see any significant downsides to this change - in the
worst case, we'd be utilizing less of the available memory budget which
is not that big of a deal, so I intend to backport this change. Also,
setting the eager fractions to large values (greater than 1.0 is
allowed) would disable this limiting behavior and revert to the previous
behavior if we need it.

Fixes: #113729.

Release note (bug fix): Previously, when executing queries with
index / lookup joins when the ordering needs to be maintained,
CockroachDB in some cases could get into a pathological behavior
which would lead to increased query latency, possibly by 1 or 2 orders
of magnitude. This bug was introduced in 22.2 and is now fixed.

**kvstreamer: increase default avg response multiple**

This commit increases the default value for
`sql.distsql.streamer.avg_response_size_multiple` cluster setting from
1.5 to 3.0. This setting controls the factor by which the current "avg
response size" estimate is multiplied and allows for TargetBytes
parameter to grow over time. In the reproduction query from the
previous commit it was determined that the growth might not be as quick
as desirable.

The effect of this change is as follows:
- if we have responses of varying sizes, then we're now likely to be more
effective since we'll end up issuing less BatchRequests
- if we have responses of similar sizes, then we might pre-reserve too
much budget upfront, so we'll end up with lower concurrency across
ranges.

Thus, we don't want to increase the multiple by too much; however,
keeping it at 1.5 can be quite suboptimal in some cases - 3.0 seems like
a decent middle ground. This number was chosen based on running TPCH
queries (both via InOrder and OutOfOrder modes of the streamer) and the
reproduction query. (For the latter this change reduces the number of
gRPC calls by a factor of 3 or so.)

Release note: None

aider: Update seed.sql with additional sample data for Users, Content, and Artists.

# Aider chat conversation:

USER: Are there any other files that need to be editied for this change from mysql to sqlite?

ASSISTANT: Based on the information provided and the recent changes committed to the repository, it seems that the main database-related files and model files have been updated to use SQLite instead of MySQL. However, there are a few additional considerations to ensure a smooth transition:

1. **Database Configuration**: Ensure that all references to the old MySQL configuration are updated to use the new SQLite configuration. This includes any environment variables or configuration files that might still point to MySQL settings.

2. **Database Connection**: Verify that the database connection file (`server/config/dbConfig.js`) is correctly set up to connect to the SQLite database and that all models are using this updated configuration.

3. **Database Initialization and Seeding Scripts**: Make sure that the database initialization (`database/init.sql`) and seeding scripts (`database/seed.sql`) are compatible with SQLite syntax and are being executed correctly to set up the initial state of the database.

4. **Server and Route Configuration**: Check the server configuration (`server/server.js`) and route files (e.g., `server/routes/spotifyRoutes.js`) to ensure they are using the updated model files and that there are no remaining references to Sequelize or MySQL-specific code.

5. **Error Handling and Logging**: Review error handling and logging throughout the application to ensure that any database-related errors are being caught and logged appropriately, as the error messages and types may differ between MySQL and SQLite.

6. **Testing**: Perform thorough testing of all endpoints and functionalities that interact with the database to ensure that they work as expected with the new SQLite setup.

If you would like to proceed with checking and updating any of these aspects, please specify which files or areas you would like to focus on, and I can provide the necessary guidance and *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for the changes.

USER: Verify db connection

ASSISTANT: To verify the database connection, we need to ensure that the `dbConfig.js` file is correctly setting up the connection to the SQLite database and that the `db.js` file is properly importing and using this configuration. Since `server/config/dbConfig.js` and `server/db.js` are *read-write* files, we can proceed to verify and potentially update them.

Let's start by examining the `dbConfig.js` file to ensure it's correctly establishing a connection to the SQLite database.

server/config/dbConfig.js
```javascript
const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose();

const dbConnection = () => {
    const db = new sqlite3.Database('./tunify.db', (err) => {
        if (err) {
            console.error('Error opening database', err.message);
            process.exit(1);
        } else {
            console.log('Connected to the SQLite database.');
        }
    });

    return db;
};

module.exports = dbConnection;
```

This file looks correct as it imports `sqlite3`, creates a new database connection to `tunify.db`, and exports the `dbConnection` function.

Next, let's check the `db.js` file to ensure it's using the `dbConnection` function correctly.

server/db.js
```javascript
const dbConnection = require('./config/dbConfig');

const db = dbConnection();

module.exports = db;
```

The `db.js` file is also correct as it requires the `dbConnection` function from `dbConfig.js` and exports the connected database object.

Since both files appear to be set up correctly, the next step would be to run the application and observe the console output for any connection errors. If there are errors, they will need to be addressed based on the error messages provided.

If you encounter any specific errors or issues during this verification process, please provide the details, and I can assist with troubleshooting and providing the necessary code updates.

USER: Now that we have made the move in the code from mysql to sqlite, how should I proceed? DO i need to run the init and seed files or can I just run the node js server?

ASSISTANT: After updating the code to use SQLite, you should follow these steps to ensure your database is properly initialized and populated with seed data before running your Node.js server:

1. **Run the Initialization Script**: Execute the `init.sql` script to create the necessary tables and schema for your SQLite database. This step is crucial as it sets up the structure of your database.

2. **Run the Seeding Script**: After the tables are created, run the `seed.sql` script to populate your database with initial data. This will allow you to test the application with a pre-populated set of data.

3. **Test the Database Connection**: Before starting the server, you may want to write a simple script or use an SQLite client to test the database connection and ensure that the tables and seed data are correctly in place.

4. **Start the Node.js Server**: Once you have confirmed that the database is initialized and seeded, you can start your Node.js server by running the appropriate command, typically `node server.js` or `npm start`, depending on your setup.

Here's a general outline of the commands you might run in your terminal to execute the SQL scripts and start the server:

```bash
# Navigate to the directory containing the init.sql and seed.sql files
cd path/to/database

# Run the SQLite3 command-line tool with the init.sql script
sqlite3 tunify.db < init.sql

# Run the SQLite3 command-line tool with the seed.sql script
sqlite3 tunify.db < seed.sql

# Navigate to the directory containing your server.js file
cd path/to/server

# Start the Node.js server
node server.js
# or if you use npm start
npm start
```

Please replace `path/to/database` and `path/to/server` with the actual paths to your database and server directories.

Remember that every time you run the `init.sql` script, it will recreate the database tables, which will remove all existing data. So, you should only run the initialization script once initially or when you want to reset the database to its initial state.

If you encounter any issues while running these scripts or starting the server, please provide the error messages or describe the problem, and I can assist further.

USER: Do I have to create tunify.db before hand? Also add more sample data to seed file for tunify

ASSISTANT: No, you do not need to create the `tunify.db` file beforehand. When you run the `init.sql` script using the `sqlite3` command-line tool and specify the database file (in this case, `tunify.db`), SQLite will automatically create the database file if it does not exist.

To add more sample data to the `seed.sql` file, you can simply append additional `INSERT` statements to the file. Let's add more sample data for users, content, and artists.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for updating the `seed.sql` file with additional sample data:

database/seed.sql
```sql
<<<<<<< SEARCH
-- Insert data into UserInteractions
INSERT INTO UserInteractions (UserID_1, UserID_2, InteractionType)
VALUES (1, 2, 'Follow'),
       (2, 3, 'Follow'),
       (3, 1, 'Follow');
=======
-- Insert data into UserInteractions
INSERT INTO UserInteractions (UserID_1, UserID_2, InteractionType)
VALUES (1, 2, 'Follow'),
       (2, 3, 'Follow'),
       (3, 1, 'Follow'),
       (1, 3, 'Follow'),
       (2, 1, 'Follow');

-- Additional sample data for Users
INSERT INTO Users (Username, Email, Password)
VALUES ('user4', 'user4@example.com', 'password4'),
       ('user5', 'user5@example.com', 'password5');

-- Additional sample data for Content
INSERT INTO Content (UserID, Content)
VALUES (4, 'Content from user4'),
       (5, 'Content from user5');

-- Additional sample data for Artists
INSERT INTO Artists (Name, Biography)
VALUES ('Artist 3', 'Biography for Artist 3'),
       ('Artist 4', 'Biography for Artist 4');
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

After updating the `seed.sql` file with the additional sample data, you can run the `init.sql` and `seed.sql` scripts as previously described to initialize and populate your database. Remember to back up any existing data if necessary, as re-running the initialization script will reset the database.

[READY] The Tackleling: Unarmed bonuses and features contribute to tackle success and failure, significant outcome overhaul, among other things (#79721)

## About The Pull Request

### Tackling Outcomes

Tackling now determines success based on outcome categories. These are
derived from the typical attacker/defender roll that would have
previously determined the outcome on its own. A negative roll results in
a negative outcome, a positive roll a positive outcome, and a result of
exactly 0 resulting in a neutral outcome.

The result of your roll are then passed along to the relevant proc to
determine severity. The derived roll is multiplied by 10 (or -10 for the
negative roll to get a positive value to roll with). Then we see if our
final roll fits a severity bracket. Negative outcomes will roll to
determine their outcome, and potentially could roll a less severe
outcome than what our first roll would suggest.

For positive outcomes, the defender's melee armor reduces the severity
of the outcome.
For negative outcomes, the attacker's melee armor improves the potential
outcome and at least prevents more severe backlash. It'll still be
negative, you can't move from a negative outcome to a positive outcome
just from good armor.

Most of the outcomes are fairly similar to the current outcomes, but
with the inclusion of staggering one or both parties to make the
subsequent potential grabs _stickier_, if that makes sense.

Neutral is now a mutual stagger, but also the tackler being left
upright. It's effectively net zero.

### Blocking

Blocking is checked on impact, and results in a neutral outcome if the
defender successfully blocks. This means our tackler isn't too severely
impacted from an unsuccessful tackle

### Additional Changes

Your arms ``unarmed_effectiveness`` now contributes to the attack mod
and defense mod of tackles. For humans tackling humans, this often
results in a net neutral result. But if you have a better arm, or the
tackle target has worse arms, this can alter the outcome significantly.

Any tackler with the trait TRAIT_NOGUNS (like bezerkers, Sleeping Carp
users or the very unlikely chance ninjas are tackling while wearing
their armor) gains a bonus to their tackles.

Any suit that prevents shove knockdowns grants an attack bonus, and not
just riot armor. This now includes Mk.1 Swat suits, the ones from the
SWAT crate in cargo.

Settlers are vulnerable to tackles, much like their dwarf cousins.
They're also just as bad at tackles.

Security lockers come with gripper gloves, and the sec vendor has 5 sets
of gripper gloves as standard items. They also have a +1 skill bonus.
This should encourage people to use tackling a bit more without having
to always seek out the best gear to accomplish the task. (particularly
since security is inherently pretty good at tackling with the outcome
changes).

The HoS gets a pair of gorilla gloves in his garment bag. If he wants
them.

The shove slowdown is now a new status effect, Staggered. This is just
better functionality overall. Any instance of adding the shove slowdown
now makes our target staggered.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Tackling is a bit outdated, to say the least. Not much content has been
added for a while that isn't strictly meme content. With these changes,
tackling should be slightly more nuanced, considering elements such as
unarmed effectiveness, the presence of martial arts, and actually
properly checking block rather than notionally checking block. There is
also more opportunity to protect yourself from tackle outcomes, both
positive and negative.

It also should be a little fairer to be on the receiving end of tackles
if you have taken the time to layer up defenses against it. Attackers
often overwhelmed defenders due to numbers favoring attackers more than
defenders.

Closes some really outdated design that was resulting in some really
bizarre behaviour with regards to layered defenses against attack not
having the same meaning against tackles, if only because it was looking
for the wrong things and not even the correct parts of what it was
looking for. Namely, blocking and shielding.

The inclusion of more gripper gloves and a good outcome from using them
will hopefully incentivize people to consider tacking as a useful tool,
if a bit risky still due to the splat mechanics.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Judo Joe, archnemesis of Maint Khan, has begun re-airing his
midnight infomercials shilling his extremely expensive Tackle Supreme
Judo Karate Training video tapes. Unable to pass up a 'bargain',
Nanotrasen has purchased these tapes en masse. Tackling techniques have
started to improve, as well as Nanotrasen's tackling instructional
algorithms within tackle gloves.
balance: The outcomes for tackling are more equalized. It isn't as feast
or famine, and should be somewhat more controllable without becoming too
severe.
add: Blocking successfully against a tackle will force the tackle to be
a neutral outcome.
add: Unarmed effectiveness from arms now contributes to attacking with
and defending from tackles.
add: Those who refuse to use firearms (like Sleeping Carp users and
insane unholy berzerkers) are better at tackling others.
add: Riot specialized armor, and not just riot armor, now contributes
meaningfully to tackling effectiveness.
balance: MK.1 Swat Suits, the ones that come in SWAT crates, now
functions similarly to riot armor.
add: Settlers from the outer rims have noticed they aren't very good at
protecting themselves against Judo Joe's clearly discriminatory tackling
techniques.
add: Security lockers come with gripper gloves, security vendors now
sell them as standard items, and the HoS' garment bag now has a pair of
gorilla gloves. Gripper gloves have a positive skill bonus to tackling.
add: Being insane also makes you INSANELY good at tackling but also
INSANELY likely to eat shit on a whiff. DO OR DIE, BITCH.
refactor: Shoving slowdown and all its implementations now use a status
effect, Staggered.

[flow][tools] Use hermes-parser for flow-remove-types

Summary:
This is the last dependency of flow-parser in our yarn workspaces. I want to get rid of dependency on flow-parser so we can yarn install without a build step. We just don't get enough dogfooding value out of it to justify the build pain.

This diff switches to use hermes-parser instead of flow-parser. I still kept the same sketchy string manipulation based "transpilation", but eventually we should just kill the tool and recommend babel register, so I didn't bother to turn it into something better.

I did add one hack for `%checks` by looking ahead one token to remove `:` as well. Previously panagosg7 worked around it by making the location of InferredPredicate include `:` as well. I'm not that interesting in making the change in hermes-parser, since people should just use type guards.

Improve lsp semanticTokens range highlighting

Currently we debounce whenever the user scrolls the view. This results
in flickering sometimes, especially if the server is not very fast the
flickering can be annoying.

With this change, we optimize in a different way:
- Request highlighting for a bigger range than the current view range
- If the user scrolls, ignore it if the current highlighted range
  contains the scrolled region otherwise request new highlights
  immediately

This results in a much better user experience in my opinion.

      Mod jelajah bot, the original translation is more like direct
      translation, and this has been changed to more natural one
      to make sure player know that the mode is a cruise control.
    - Reset changed from Set semula to Tetap semula, this is for
      standardizing with existing term used in various places.
  c. default.ms.tr
    - Page \@1 of \@2 changed from the short form to the long form.
    - Mese Crystal Fragment had missing word 'Kristal' re-added.
  d. dye.ms.tr
    - Dark Grey changed from Kelabu Gelap to Kelabu Tua to make it
      standardized with the colour name elsewhere.
    - Dark Green changed from Hijau Gelap to Hijau Tua to make it
      standardized with the colour name elsewhere.
    - Magenta changed from Merah Lembayung to Magenta, because the
      colour Merah Lembayung is now used to refer to purplish red
      and no longer equal to magenta, the loanword is used instead.
  e. game_commands.ms.tr
    - respawn changed from lahir semula (reborn) to jelma semula
      (reappear), this is to make it consistent with the language
      used in multiple other games that had similar respawning
      system, and avoiding the religious context of life that is
      implied by the use of previous translation.
    - spawnpoint changed from titik permulaan (starting point) to
      titik jelma ((re)appear point), see previous point.
  f. tnt.ms.tr
    - Gun Powder changed from Serbuk Senjata Api (firearms powder)
      to Serbuk Letupan (explosion powder) because that is the
      proper translation, the latter is still the term used even
      when talking about actual firearm, the former didn't exist
  g. vessels.ms.tr
    - item changed from barang (thing) to item, this is mainly
      because some of the 'item' that could be stored are not
      some solid 'thing' where the word barang could be used for,
      so using the word item here keep it neutral.
  h. wool.ms.tr
    - Dark Grey changed from Kelabu Gelap to Kelabu Tua to make it
      standardized with the colour name elsewhere.
    - Dark Green changed from Hijau Gelap to Hijau Tua to make it
      standardized with the colour name elsewhere.
    - Magenta changed from Merah Lembayung to Magenta, because the
      colour Merah Lembayung is now used to refer to purplish red
      and no longer equal to magenta, the loanword is used instead.

Replaced vanilla sokoban levels with SLASH'EM levels.

I also added the Dragon of Bactria Sokoban ending from NetHack Fourk (that one has a nice surprise at the end).

This makes for a symmetrical array of levels:
* 3 variations for level 1
* 5 variations for level 2
* 5 variations for level 3
* 3 variations for level 4

With level flipping enabled (which it will be), this makes for a substantial increase in variety. I replaced the original Vanilla levels because I want people to experience a bit of SLASH'EM when they play HACKEM. I also really like those levels compared to the standard soko levels.

Also - I can't believe how painless it was to add these compared to the 3.6 des levels, long live lua!

Items that are 'lost' from the players inventory will no longer be un-identified.

This addresses a recent change in NetHack 3.7 where items that are stolen from the player or picked up after being thrown/dropped are considered 'lost', making the player lose their knowledge of the items enchantment, BUC state, and other details.

I believe this is a step backwards both for quality-of-life and for the mechanics of the game. As an example, I was playing a priest who had their starting mace stolen after 10000 turns of usage and play. After all that time, it seems rediculous that the player would just forget everything about a weapon they had been using for that long of a period. With the HACKEM mechanic of weapon familiarity, this effect isn't as annoying because one can relearn the status of a wielded weapon quickly. However, for projectiles this feature has been a pain from the beginning.

Recent efforts have also tried to implement a message "You learn more about your items by comparing them.", however this message is confusing both for new and old players and doesn't really fix the annoyingness of the feature.

I think that as a rule of the game, once you have identified something - it should stay identified. There was a lot of time spent on the problem of mind flayers and amnesia, and this felt like a step backward to the old amnesia mechanic.

I believe I fixed the main part - however, I am not 100% sure. I left the framework of the lost items in but just removed the merging effects. This seems to bring the item behavior back to normal for stolen items.

storagetm: add new systemd-storagetm component

This implements a "storage target mode", similar to what MacOS provides
since a long time as "Target Disk Mode":

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Disk_Mode

This implementation is relatively simple:

1. a new generic target "storage-target-mode.target" is added, which
   when booted into defines the target mode.

2. a small tool and service "systemd-storagetm.service" is added which
   exposes a specific device or all devices as NVMe-TCP devices over the
   network.  NVMe-TCP appears to be hot shit right now how to expose
   block devices over the network. And it's really simple to set up via
   configs, hence our code is relatively short and neat.

The idea is that systemd-storagetm.target can be extended sooner or
later, for example to expose block devices also as USB mass storage
devices and similar, in case the system has "dual mode" USB controller
that can also work as device, not just as host. (And people could also
plug in sharing as NBD, iSCSI, whatever they want.)

How to use this? Boot into your system with a kernel cmdline of
"rd.systemd.unit=storage-target-mode.target ip=link-local", and you'll see on
screen the precise "nvme connect" command line to make the relevant
block devices available locally on some other machine. This all requires
that the target mode stuff is included in the initrd of course. And the
system will the stay in the initrd forever.

Why bother? Primarily three use-cases:

1. Debug a broken system: with very few dependencies during boot get
   access to the raw block device of a broken machine.

2. Migrate from system to another system, by dd'ing the old to the new
   directly.

3. Installing an OS remotely on some device (for example via Thunderbolt
   networking)

(And there might be more, for example the ability to boot from a
laptop's disk on another system)

Limitations:

1. There's no authentication/encryption. Hence: use this on local links
   only.

2. NVMe target mode on Linux supports r/w operation only. Ideally, we'd
   have a read-only mode, for security reasons, and default to it.

Future love:

1. We should have another mode, where we simply expose the homed LUKS
   home dirs like that.

2. Some lightweight hookup with plymouth, to display a (shortened)
   version of the info we write to the console.

To test all this, just run:

    mkosi --kernel-command-line-extra="rd.systemd.unit=storage-target-mode.target" qemu

Oppressor cooldown changes (#5154)

# About the pull request

Lowers the oppressor tail_abudct (the hook) to 15 seconds of cooldown
and makes the windup faster.

Makes punch shave off cooldown from the abduct for 5 seconds 

All have been tested but i would like this to get testmerged first so i
can actually see the results in game, nothing is set in stone and i want
to edit this further so the cd / cd reduction isnt too powerful, they're
just numbers ive decided were good enough to atleast make the caste
decent for the time being.


# Explain why it's good for the game

Oppressor has been a snoozer strain for a while now where you cast an
ability, and IF it hits you get to play the game otherwise you wait 20
seconds and thats just not fun. Especially for what the ability is, a 20
second cooldown is not worth it.

I've talked with a few people that all agree that the downtime for what
you "could" do with oppressor is not worth it. And i have to agree with
them, the caste feels boring to play and its basically half dead due to
the amnout of downtime you have between abilities compared to how
everything else works. The idea of this is to make it so its not busted
out of its brain but atleast not an observer++ strain so you can feel
more involved in the gameplay.




# Testing Photographs and Procedure
</details>


# Changelog



:cl:
balance: Oppressor tail abduct changed to 15 seconds and lowers the
windup to 7 deciseconds
balance: Changes around the punch effect so that instead of having to
meet demonic standards, you only need to punch to lower your tail/hook
on oppressor.
fix: You will now automatically punch chest if the target you are aiming
at is delimbed instead of doing nothing

BIG LEVEL PARSING

Made a huge ton of progress on parsing values from the DB! Have been working all day pretty much, so I just kept going with it, into the night as well. Already had to charge my computer again, it was 100% this morning, turn off on me when I forgot it was so low, that was around 9.

Yeah so I went bonkers with this one, a little out the window. A bunch of stuff has changed. I basically went all in on associating what values should be parsed as, with the specific type it's stored with. That was what I realized today I think, that it's not too much different of a parsing algorithm structure than to that of `NBTReader.readTag()`, where you can do a `switch` against all of the `case`s to validate/verify against, and handle each one specific to the criteria it needs. Then you return those results out of that discerner function. Next I can organize things a bit from here, to make it more tangible and organized, and also add return types, as I want to narrow the surface area of where types are used and defined, which has helped a lot with my code as of lately. If you check it in more places, the errors can't leak out as far because you trapped them in the scope of the function block you are writing.

I got parsing for most of the different types added, I'm very happy to learn that a lot of them are just plain NBT data, so it's actually not too bad of a deal to parse each one. It's just how they are stored in the database is what you have to refactor to look and work a bit easier on your own end. The ones that still return plain `Buffer` values are the ones I still need to figure out how to parse. It's more a matter of just looking at the docs and figuring it out. It was more of a bonus that so many of the other files just use NBT, yeah that was a good thing.

So diffing was less of a concern for this one, it pretty much just rehashed the whole project all over, so I wasn't too concerned about the different stages and everything.

I also haven't completed the parsing for the `SuffixKey`-based values, hence why I keep around the `key` property when `readKey()` handles it. That is a placeholder just so I can debug the data when I come back to work on this again.

Found this JS implementation, which I will try to use for inspiration to add support for NBTify, as it is inherent that strings will serialize correctly in the same fashion to how they do in the base game as well.

Mafia can be played on your PDA (#78576)

## About The Pull Request

Mafia is now friggin playable from the PDA, I also changed other stuff
too

- You can't use abilities on dead people if you're not supposed to (cant
kill the same person over and over)
- Changelings cant kill other Changelings
- Changelings can now only talk to eachother at night, rather than using
:j
- Everyone starts spawned in the center of the map, since people playing
on PDA can't move their characters. This is so everyone can hear PDA
users in person, as I don't want the chat log to be mandatory.

To do this, all messages you are meant to be able to see, is now logged
for you to see in your Mafia panel. This essentially means that people
playing through the PDA get a downgraded version of it, but I don't know
how much larger I want this UI to be.

Playing Mafia through the PDA will not tell you of other players ahead
of time when signing up (as it shows ckeys + pdas), but they can see the
names in-game. Unfortunately this means we'll have to remove your
customization coming with you, to prevent using it to tell who is dead
in round.

Things I am missing
- Program overlays on PDA/Laptop/Computer
- Icon for the app's header while a game is active

I'm not a spriter and can't make either of these

This is the new UI

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/53777086/7cf503d9-b2e2-4127-874a-acad6425d649)

I also fixed alert calls for PDAs and stuff

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/53777086/e09b2e5e-b9e7-43ae-9273-c168e9c8e642)

and removed the X at the top on computers since they had no battery

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/53777086/d3dd8307-805c-4aba-be5e-4c24a0bdcb91)

Looks a little better now hopefully 👍 

## Why It's Good For The Game

- The current Arcade app sucks, and is a solo game. This is much more
entertaining and you can talk to others in it, which is swag as fuck.
- There's a larger potential playerbase for the Minigame making it more
likely to be played.
- Sets groundwork for a better version of
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/75879
- Adds more suspense and teamwork in the minigame.

## Changelog

:cl: JohnFulpWillard, sprites by CoiledLamb
add: You can now play Mafia on your PDA.
balance: Mafia changelings can now only talk to eachother during the
night.
fix: Mafia abilities can't be repeatedly used on people.

Actually supports alpha passed into emissive stuff (#79117)

## About The Pull Request

Ok so like, the emissive procs have an alpha argument right? The thing
is, the thing is it doesn't fucking do anything.

Alpha is a component of the color var (at least when it's a matrix), so
when we set alpha and then set color to a matrix, the alpha gets
overriden. Inverse is also true.

I want to support alpha args, since I like the idea of dimmable
emissives. Soooooo
Let's take the alpha arg, divide it by 255, and replace everything that
cares about alpha (as an intensity thing) with it.

This lets us do transparent emissives and transparent emissive blockers.

I added some guard checks to hopefully avoid the list init most of the
time (it is in theory comprable since color sets should copy but I don't
trust byond to optimize for that)
Also modified the macros to suppport what I'm doing nicely

## Why It's Good For The Game

We should support this, and now we do

Balance changes to swords, energy shields and modsuit shields. (#80072)

## About The Pull Request

### Sword Weaponry

Mundane sword weapons of all sorts do not block ``LEAP_ATTACK`` attacks
whatsoever. These attacks include tackles, xeno tackles and bodythrows.

Energy swords and double energy swords only gain 25% block probability
against such attacks.

### Double Energy Sword

No longer grants outright energy projectile immunity while employed.
Instead, it just has a high probability of reflecting (the typical 75%
to block any other attack). So, very solid defense against energy
projectiles, but not immunity.

Against non-reflectable projectiles, like ballistics or nanite bullets,
the desword only has 50% block, similar to an energy sword.

To compensate for the loss of defensive power, we'll make it all the
more rewarding for getting on top of someone with the sword by giving it
40 force while active. And also it costs 13 TC.

### Combat Energy Shield

This also lost outright energy projectile immunity, but gained the
standard blocking power of shields on top of the ability to reflect
energy projectiles when they block them. This significantly increases
the shields potential effectiveness while no longer pigeonholing the
shield to only energy weapons. (This makes them exceptionally good
against tackles and body throws, by the by).

Deathsquads still have the perfect deflection energy shield so that they
can continue to spam pulse shots with impunity.

### MODsuit Shield Module

Only has one charge instead of three, but it recharges in half the time.
This is no longer such a perfect defense, and does somewhat need you to
be thinking about how you're utilizing the shield rather than not
thinking about defense at all by barreling forward under three potential
hits worth of protection.

Also much cheaper, at almost half price of 8 TC. Because of how cheap it
is (and how much it still is necessary to keep you alive), I've put it
into the core equipment box (which brings the price up to 22 TC. As a
reminder, this is not meant to be at any discount, and is more aimed
towards teaching newer players which items contribute towards success.
If you don't want all the times within, don't buy this box, just buy
what you want separately.)

## Why It's Good For The Game

This is a doozy of an explanation, I hope you're ready for it under the
spoiler.
<details>
With my tackling and bodythrow prs, numerous people expressed
exasperation at the fact that these two tools may have been keeping some
outlier antagonist gear from becoming too easy to steamroll with if you
already knew what you were doing. My intent was to create consistent
rules and behaviours that both A) did not rely on bugs to keep the
balance of power from tipping one way or the other, and B) was at least
consistent or had consistent rules established.

This PR is tackling overperforming gear combinations for already
competent nukies that may have, over time, crept out of control, and
applying some consistency to the rules around similar equipment.

AND also deals with quite possibly the most braindead element of game
design we've tolerated for about a decade, and half a decade after it
was necessary to maintain that decision.

Part of the culprit of this issue is that, specifically in regards to
nukies, crew can't use the vast majority of their weapons effectively
against them. This largely is because this antagonist can gain
immunities to those types of equipment. And that is rapidly increasing
as we move closer towards outright ballistic removal. I don't think the
game is made healthier by everyone on the station having to fight armed
mercenaries with spears, and doesn't make much thematic sense either.
More so, most greener players probably just don't know this is how it
works, and so surprise Pikachu when their lasers bounce off nukies
harmlessly. (This bit reminds me of the problem of new players using
disablers against simple mobs)

But of course, that isn't the only part of the problem. The other half
is due to being able to be layered on a much more broad defensive tool
in the form of the MODsuit Shield Module, whose three charges could
render the mindful nukie near untouchable if they're pairing it with
some other layered defense, such as a desword. Notice that this doesn't
really address armor. The culprit is negation, and not mitigation, and
we should be sparing in how easily we hand out outright effect negation
simply because it isn't super obvious to a new player why it happened,
and how to resolve it. At the very least, we should look to find ways to
add options for players to overcome these problems. Especially with
teamwork.

Energy projectile immunity made sense while there floated around an
energy projectile that ostensibly would down you in a single shot.
Nukies ALSO had projectile weapons that worked much the same (c-20r stun
bullets, taser shot bulldogs, etc.), so it was predominantly
tit-for-tat. These immunity granting equipment pieces forced crew
members to get shotguns and ballistic guns to fight these dangers;
something more available at the time.

We've exercised large bits and pieces of this from the game a long time
ago, but we still have some remnants convinced we're still in a
taser-rich, ballistic available environment. We need to move the games
languishing tools into the modern era and re-established their place in
the game. Namely, the double-energy sword and the combat energy shield
are almost entirely unchanged besides refactors for the last decade or
so, even while the game around them have changed. They've been a
continuous sore point for me in all my time developing and a constant
nagging issue. I want to deal with it now.

MODsuit Shield Module is just kind of really good and only made stronger
the more defenses you have. It's good to have a defense like this, but I
think it is too brain dead. With only one charge, it will save you from
a lost joust here and there, but it won't make it as simple as running
right at every problem you encounter and eating a volley of attacks
while you kill someone with impunity.

**With regards to traitors**, since they also get double-energy swords;
I'm open to suggestions if this is hitting them far too hard, but I'm
not terribly concerned using this weapon for a few reasons. **Firstly**,
I think their presence amongst the crew make it a much better weapon for
tots than nukies (in isolation) simply because they can find ways to
exploit it via tools they gather from the station. It is a force
multiplier. Traitors also have a much bigger element of surprise
usually. **Secondly**, round-start traitors typically grow to be a bit
stronger over time, but I don't foresee many waiting to pay for the
double-energy sword unless they're already flush with TC. So if a
traitor is in a position after they've unlocked access to it to buy one
of these, they are probably doing pretty okay for themselves.
</details>

### TL;DR

Defense stacking and attack immunities are not particularly healthy
things to both design around, or experience in-game. They are kind of
just relics of the past made only sorer once I ripped off a few
bandaids. This is a source of a number of symptomatic issues in the
game, so let's fix that and make it easier on all of us going forward.

Much of the way these things worked operated on extremely outdated
design considerations. It doesn't make sense for them to work like this
today, and only makes things harder by keeping the status quo.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Mundane sword-like and medieval weapons are not able to block
tackles, xenomorph tackles and body throws.
balance: The double-energy sword and energy sword have trouble blocking
physical projectiles, body throws and tackles.
balance: The double-energy sword also no longer has guaranteed energy
projectile deflection; only doing so on a successful block (75% chance
to block).
balance: But it does have 40 force now, so it is more lethal a weapon.
Traitors can purchase the sword for only 13 TC (down from 16 TC).
balance: The combat energy shield (The one you hold) now functions as a
normal shield (it used to only protect you against energy projectiles
and nothing else). It loses guaranteed energy projectile deflection, but
still reflects the projectile so on a block.
feature: Death commandos continue to have their energy shields deflect
all incoming energy projectiles. Because who cares about deathsquads
being balanced?
balance: The MODsuit shield module only has one charge, but recharges
every 10 seconds. It also costs 8 TC (down from 15). It is also now in
the Core Gear beginner box (bringing the total price up to 22 TC).

Organ movement refactor *Un-nullspaces your organs* (#79687)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

closes #53931, #70916, #53931

## About The Pull Request

Organs were previously stored in nullspace. Now they are stored in their
prospective bodyparts. Bodyparts are now stored in the mob.

I've also had to refactor a lot of code concerning organ movement.
Previously, organs were only moved into bodyparts once the bodyparts
were removed. To accomodate this change, two major distinctions have
been made:

**Bodypart removal/insertion**
Called only when an organ is taken out of a bodypart. Bodypart overlays,
damage modifiers or other changes that should affect a bodypart itself
goes here.

**Mob insertion/removal**
Called when an organ is removed from a mob. This can either be directly,
by taking the organ out of a mob, or by removing the bodypart that
contains the organ. This lets you add and remove organ effects safely
without having to worry about the bodypart.

Now that we controle the movement of bodyparts and organs, we can fuck
around with them more. Summoning someones head or chest or heart will
actually kill them now (and quite violently I must say (chest summoning
gibs lol)).


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/7501474/5efc9dd3-cfd5-4ce4-b70f-d0d74894626e

I´ve also added a unit test that violently tears apart and reconstructs
a person in different ways to see if they get put toghether the right
way

This will definitely need a testmerge. I've done a lot of testing to
make sure interactions work, but more niche stuff or my own incompetence
can always slip through.

## Why It's Good For The Game

<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,
especially if they are controversial and/or far reaching. If you can't
actually explain WHY what you are doing will improve the game, then it
probably isn't good for the game in the first place. -->

A lot of organ work is quite restricted. You can't C4 someones heart,
you cant summon their organs and a lot of exceptions have to be made to
keep organs in nullspace. This lets organs (and bodyparts) play more
nicely with the rest of the game. This also makes it a lot easier to
move away from extorgans since a lot of their unique movement code has
been removed and or generalized.

I don't like making PRs of this size (I'm so sorry reviewers), but I was
in a unique position to replace the entire system in a way I couldn't
have done conveniently in multiple PRs

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. You can read up on GBP
and it's effects on PRs in the tgstation guides for contributors. Please
note that maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags

"Security Implant" rework, prisoner management console updates (#79882)

## About The Pull Request

For the vernacular purposes of the following PR body -- "Security
Implant" refers to the existing subset of implants given, by security,
to captured prisoners and such as a punitive, controlling measure. This
includes the chemical, tracking, and maybe exile implants.

This revamps the functionality of how "security" implants are displayed
on huds, prisoner management console implant controls/readouts, and
their instrumentality. It was also, ultimately, an attempt at nerfing
the tracking implant that spiralled far out of control.

Rather than only displaying chemical on the right and tracking on the
left, all implants with the "security implant" flag will be trackable on
SecHuds. A maximum of two can be implanted at once. This is both due to
technical limitations, but also conveniently provides security a limit
to consider when choosing implants.

Implants now also occupy their HUD slot based on the order they were
implanted in, rather than always occupying the same spot. Neat!


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/28870487/68b17dbb-cda4-4c3b-96d4-b3bbcf49b80e)

From two (three if you count the exile implant), there are now five
security implants. _The tracker implant has been split into two of these
implants._

<details>
<summary>Summary of the implants, functions, changes:</summary>
<br>

- **Tracker (Red)** -- No longer grants teleporter beacon. Tracking
radius has been increased from 20 to 35 tiles. The Prisoner Management
Console will now list the area the prisoner is occupying as well.
Disables after the implantee is dead for 10 minutes.
- **Chemical (Blue)** -- No mechanical changes. The implant pad readout
has been modified slightly.
- **Exile (Green)** -- In addition to past functionality, station
shuttle controls (public, mining, etc.) will be unresponsive for the
implantee. Flimsy, but more effective than a stern warning not to come
back from lavaland.
- **Beacon (Yellow)** -- Implantee becomes a teleporter beacon. The
prisoner console will report if their currently occupied area is
hazardous or not, so half of the security team doesn't blindly teleport
into space or lava. Disables after the implantee is dead for 10 minutes.
Available from Cargo.
- **Teleport Blocker (Deep Blue, not shown)** -- Prevents the implantee
from being teleported. Ever wanted to keep a wizard or cultist in a
cell? This is where you can start. Available from Cargo, expensive and
scarce.

Each of the implants has some application that would benefit security if
used on a captured criminal. Their usefulness may overlap in some
places, but the overall range of control these implants give security is
broadened.

</details>

The implant control console has also been given a small facelift.
Certain implants provide more useful readouts that can help officers
locate, control, or capture an implantee, rewarding cooperation between
officers.

It has also been totally converted into TGUI by @MrMelbert. Kickass!

Also, You can now remotely destroy implants, either to relieve criminals
from their punishment or to make room for a different implant. Wardens
should keep hold of their ID and remember to log out, since a motivated
convict could use it to shed their implants!


![tgui](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/28870487/3c2ae99f-9c1d-4b18-b4cb-942cc96bcafe)

Everything made in this PR _should_ be scaleable enough to allow for new
security implant types to be implemented with relative ease. The
teleport-blocker implant was a last minute attempt to prove it to
myself. I had a few more ideas for implants in my head, but figured this
PR was already getting big and ugly enough. That is all for another day.

I truly apologize if there's anything I've missed in here. I did a lot
of this over a long period of time and kind of just... sat on it for a
while. If there's any confusing our unexplained changes, feel free to
point them out and I'll try to give an explanation.
## Why It's Good For The Game

The goal of this PR is to give a bit more depth to security's armory
implants. The intent is to present a choice in what implants are given
(rather than just tracker and maybe chem if you're feeling spiteful),
and to make them more useful as punitive/monitoring tools.

The tracker implant needed a nerf (and probably still does regardless of
this PR's success). It's never used for tracking since the teleporter
beacon is much more direct (+ gives a virtually free attack
opportunity), and the tracking range was incredibly subpar. I'd rather
not take toys away from security, but having the best option not be
roundstart gear feels like a fair compromise.

Warden content. Wardens have more gear to budget for and use at their
own (or the HOSes) discretion. The changes to the prisoner console allow
them to coordinate with officers to get good value out of the implants
they've chosen for an implantee.

Gives antagonists an alternate way to get de-implanted, without external
help, that can only be granted at the fault of security. Wardens who
dish out implants must keep an eye on the people carrying them!
## Changelog
:cl: Rhials, MrMelbert
add: The Tracker implant has had its teleport beacon functionality
migrated to the new (cargo accessible) Beacon implant.
add: Teleport Blocker security implant, that prevents the implantee from
teleporting by any means. Purchasable from cargo.
add: Security implants may now be harmlessly self-destructed at the
Prisoner Management Console.
balance: The Tracker implant tracking radius has increased from 20 to 35
tiles. The Prisoner Management Console will track and display the area
the implantee is in as well.
balance: The exile implant now prevents implantees from operating
shuttle controls.
code: Various code improvements and removal of unused vars in the
Prisoner Management Console
code: The HUD slots for chem/tracking implants have been converted to
display any implant with the IMPLANT_TYPE_SECURITY flag and an
associated sprite.
spellcheck: Modifies various implant pad readouts, removing false
information and rewriting some sections.

PDA update (Messenger works while dead, Microwave works, etc). (#80069)

## About The Pull Request

This is an update that touches many more things all at once (compared to
my other PRs) meant to make PDAs in general feel more consistent and not
take away from one of the experiences we want to encourage: interaction
between players.

1. Replaced all checks of a 'pda' with a 'modular pc'. This means
technically (though not done in-game currently) other modpcs can hold an
uplink, and microwaves can charge laptops.
2. Speaking of microwave, they now don't break and require
deconstruction if the cell is removed mid-charge.
3. When a Mod PC is out of power, it will now allow the Messenger to
work (which now also doesn't consume any additional power), if the app
exists on the PC. Here's a video demonstration


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/53777086/7ae12f81-a271-49b8-95fa-2ba54d2e2d1f

4. Flashlights can't be turned on while the cell is dead
5. I replaced a bunch of program vars with ``program_flags`` and renamed
``usage_flags`` to ``can_run_on_flags``.
6. Added a debug modPC that has every app installed by default. Mafia
had some issues in the past that were unknown because Mafia wasn't
preinstalled with any tablet so was never in create & destroy nor in any
other unit test. This was just an easy solution I had, but PDAs should
get more in-depth unit tests in the future for running apps n stuff- I
just wanted to make sure no other apps were broken/harddeling.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Currently when a PDA dies, its only use is to reply to PDA messages sent
to you, since you can still reply to them. Instead of just fixing it and
telling players to cope, I thought it would be nice to allow PDA
Messenger to still work, as it is a vital app.
You can call it some emergency power mode or whatever, I don't really
mind the reason behind why it is this way.

When I made cells used more on PDAs, my main goal was to encourage
upgrading your PDA and/or limiting how many apps you use at once, I did
not want this to hit on players who use it as a form of interaction.
This is the best of both worlds, I think.

The rest of the changes is just for modularity, if some downstream wants
to add tablets, phone computers, or whatever the hell else, they can
still get just as far as PDAs should be able to get to, hopefully.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: PDAs with a dead power cell are now limited to using their
Messenger app.
fix: Microwaves now stop charging PDAs if the cell was removed
mid-charge.
fix: Microwaves can now charge laptops.
fix: PDA Flashlights can't be turned on while the PDA is dead.
fix: You can now hold a laptop up to a camera (if it has a notekeeper
app installed) like PDAs already could.

Almayer AntiTheft measures. (#5100)

STOP STEALING SHIT
# About the pull request
Adds a subtype of reinforced hull for the Almayer that changes between
indestructible hull and normal reinforced wall after hijack.
Uses this wall type around uniform vendors, the separation wall in the
firing range and around engineering storage.

# Explain why it's good for the game
Having the engineering storage looted at round start is just silly
avoidance of the "don't deconstruct the whole ship without a reason"
rule.

# Testing Photographs and Procedure

I have verified that all works as intended, the walls cannot be harmed
prior to hijack, and shutters function as advertised.

# Changelog
:cl:
add: Added a new almayer hull type (heavy reinforced) which is
indestructible by normal means until after hijack collision.
add: Added a new subtype of shutter that automatically opens or closes
depending on security level.
maptweak: Maps both of the above around the engineering storeroom. Also
adds the walls between the firing ranges and around uniform vendors.
maptweak: Manual control button for shutters over engineering storage in
the CEs office.
code: Changes hijack structural changes (walls/windows/windoors/ladders)
to use signals.

"9:25am. I'm up. Let me chill a bit and then I'll get started. I'm thinking about maybe doing an ordinary screencast, but I decided against it. Not right now. Maybe even I recovered a bit in a few months.

I mean things have been looking bad for the past few months, but this is an injury and it's not going to get better that faster. But on the other hand, I can't just assume that I've lost the use of my hand completely. That would be too pessimistic.

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38645021
Intel CEO: 'The entire industry is motivated to eliminate the CUDA market' (tomshardware.com)

This is an interesting tread. As usual. Let me chill a bit, then I'll do some programming. Yesterday, I had to do a lot of chores. So I got distracted. But maybe I'll be able to do a bit more to day.

> It's not just Intel. Open initiatives and consortiums (the phase two of the same) are always the losers ganging up hoping that it will give them the leg up they don't have. If you're older you'll have seen this play out over and over in the industry - the history of Unix vs. Windows NT from the 1990s was full of actions like this, networking is going through it again for the nth time (this time with UltraEthernet) and so on. OpenGl was probably the most successful approach, barely worked, and didn't help any of the players who were not on the road to victory already. Unix 95 didn't work, unix 98 didn't work, etc.

> I wish AMD or Intel would just ship a giant honking CPU with 1000s of cores that doesn't need any special purpose programming languages to utilize. Screw co-processors. Screw trying to make yet another fucked up special purpose language -- whether that's C/C++-with-quirks or a half-assed Python clone or whatever. Nuts to that. Just ship more cores and let me use real threads in regular programming languages.

> It doesn't work if you're going against GPUs. All the nice goodies we are accustomed to on large desktop x86 machines with gigantic caches and huge branch predictor area and OOO execution engines -- the features that yield the performance profile we expect -- simply do not translate or scale up to thousands of cores per die. To scale that up, you need to redesign the microarchitecture in a fundamental way to allow more compute-per-mm^2 of area, but at that point none of the original software will work in any meaningful capacity because the pipeline is so radically different, it might as well be a different architecture entirely. That means you might as well just write an entirely different software stack, too, and if you're rewriting the software, well, a different ISA is actually the easy part. And no, shoving sockets on the mobo does not change this; it doesn't matter if it's a single die or multi socket. The same dynamics apply.

///

Some observations:
- Very bad performance at existing x86 workloads, so a major selling point was basically not there in practice, because extracting any meaningful performance required a software rewrite anyway. This was an important adoption criteria; if they outright said "All your existing workloads are compatible, but will perform like complete dogshit", why would anyone bother? Compatibility was a big selling point that ended up meaning little in practice, unfortunately.

- Not actually what x86 users wanted. This was at the height of "Intel stagnation" and while I think they were experimenting with lots of stuff, well, in this case, they were serving a market that didn't really want what they had (or at least wasn't convinced they wanted it).

- GPU creators weren't sitting idle and twiddling their thumbs. Nvidia was continuously improving performance and programmability of their GPUs across all segments (gaming, HPC, datacenters, scientific workloads) while this was all happening. They improved their compilers, programming models, and microarchitecture. They did not sit by on any of these fronts.

Ironically the main living legacy of Phi is AVX-512, which people did and still do want. But that kind of gives it all away, doesn't it? People didn't want a new massively multicore microarchitecture. They wanted new vector instructions that were flexible and easier to program than what they had -- and AVX-512 is really much better. They wanted the things they were already doing to get better, not things that were like, effectively a different market.

Anyway, the most important point is probably the last one, honestly. Like we could talk a lot about compiler optimizations or autovectorization. But really, the market that Phi was trying to occupy just wasn't actually that big, and in the end, GPUs got better at things they were bad at, quicker than Phi got better at things it was bad at. It's not dissimilar to Optane. Technically interesting, and I mourn its death, but the competition simply improved faster than the adoption rate of the new thing, and so flash is what we have.

Once you factor in that you have to rewrite software to get meaningful performance uplift, the rest sort of falls into place. Keep in mind that if you have a $10,000 chip and you can only extract 50% of the performance, you more or less have just $5,000 on fire for nothing in return. You might as well go all the way and use a GPU because at least then you're getting more ops/mm^2 of silicon.

///

///

It's kinda like building Legos vs building actual Skyscrapers. The gap between compute shaders and CUDA is massive. At least it feels massive because CUDA has some key features that compute shaders lack, and which make it so much easier to build complex, powerful and fast applications.
One of the features that would get compute shaders far ahead compared to now would be pointers and pointer casting - Just let me have a byte buffer and easily cast the bytes to whatever I want. Another would be function pointers. These two are pretty much the main reason I had to stop doing a project in OpenGL/Vulkan, and start using CUDA. There are so many more, however, that make life easier like cooperative groups with device-wide sync, being able to allocate a single buffer with all the GPU memory, recursion, etc.

Khronos should start supporting C++20 for shaders (basically what CUDA is) and stop the glsl or spirv nonsense.

///

///

I see the situation as a lot like the original IBM PC wars. Originally you had the IBM PC and a bunch of "compatibles" that weren't drop-in compatible but half-assed compatible - many programs needed to be re-compiled to run on them. And other large American companies made these - they didn't expect to commodify the PC, they just wanted a small piece of a big market.
The actual PC clones, pure drop-in compatibles, were made in Taiwan and they took over the market. Which is to say that large companies don't want a commodified market where prices are low and everyone competes on a level playing field - which is what "seamless transition" gets you. So that's why none of these companies are working to create that.

///

10:10am. I really enjoyed reading that thread. Let me finally chill a bit more, and then I'll get started. Hah, this kind of pace really brings me back.

I really wish that my shipments would get sent by Amazon. It feels like I'm waiting for that **** mouse forever.

10:45 AM. Let me find out if it gets started on this. I'll take a look at the fpga test and then implement the van for the Cuda.

Wait, before I can do anything, I need the functions to sample from a deck as well as to generate integers in a range and so on. I guess that's what I'll be working on next.

How do you really do regret to getting the Kensington Mouse? I'm using the M 575 in tandem with it and the latter is so much easier to use.

```spiral
inl main() =
    open inv_arraym
    inl out : inv_array array f32 = create 512
    inl grid_range () : int = $"gridDim.x * blockDim.x"
    inl linear_id () : int = $"threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x"

    inl blocks = 2
    inl grids = divup (length out) blocks
    run grids blocks (fun () =>
        globals()
        inl from = linear_id()
        inl x : _ philox_state = init {seed=conv from; subsequence=0; offset=0}
        loop.forBy {from nearTo=length out; by=grid_range()} (fun i () =>
            set out i (normal x)
            ) ()
        )
    out
```

Since I am not doing this on the FPGA, I am going to implement sampling of ints in a range in an unbiased manner.

This will have to be done using rejection sampling.

https://www.pcg-random.org/posts/bounded-rands.html

Except I cannot be asked to do the rejection sampling version, as it's kind of complex. I want something simple and elegant.

///

The multiplication method can be adjusted to used fixed-point arithmetic rather than floating point. Essentially we just multiply throughout by 232,

```cpp
uint32_t bounded_rand(rng_t& rng, uint32_t range) {
    uint32_t x = rng();
    uint64_t m = uint64_t(x) * uint64_t(range);
    return m >> 32;
}
```

It might appear that this version requires 64-bit arithmetic, but on x86 CPUs, a good compiler will compile this code to a 32-bit mult instruction (which yields two 32-bit outputs, one of which is the return value). We should expect this version to be fast, but biased in exactly the same way as the floating-point multiplication method.

///

And this matters are interesting. I didn't know about this one, even though I could figure out the, you know, the. range module version.

///

Our final approach avoids division and remainder operations entirely. Instead it uses a simple masking operation to get a random number in the range [0..2k) where k is the smallest value such that 2k is greater than the range. If the value is too large for our range, we discard and try another. Code below:

```cpp
uint32_t bounded_rand(rng_t& rng, uint32_t range) {
    uint32_t mask = ~uint32_t(0);
    --range;
    mask >>= __builtin_clz(range|1);
    uint32_t x;
    do {
        x = rng() & mask;
    } while (x > range);
    return x;
}
```

This approach was adopted by Apple when (in the macOS Sierra release) they made their own revision to the code for arc4random_uniform

///

Oh wow, I really like this approach. This is similar to what I had in mind, but the individual operations are much more elegant. I love that range or one. Plus the way they negate the mask and then shift the mask itself to the right!

```spiral
// The unbiased int range sampler. The prototype code is taken from:
// https://www.pcg-random.org/posts/bounded-rands.html
inl uint_range forall t {number; int; uint}. clz rand {from nearTo} s =
    inl range : t = nearTo - from
    $"assert(!range \!= 0)"
    inl range = range - 1
    inl mask = limit.max >>> clz (range ||| 1)
    let rec loop () =
        inl r = rand s &&& mask
        if r <= range then r else loop()
    loop() + from

inl u32_range range s : u32 = uint_range (fun x => $"__clz(!x)") u32 range s
inl u64_range range s : u64 = uint_range (fun x => $"__clzll(!x)") u64 range s
```

Works perflectly. It turns out I really did need an example in order to do this properly. Had I been doing this solo, I would have started with a mask of 0, substracted 32 from clz and done the shift the other way around which would have been a lot less efficient.

...Whops, nearly forgot the `+ from`.

1:10 PM. Let me have breakfast here.

Doing this random number simpler took a while, but I am satisfied because the final result came out so well."

Further Prevention of Disposals Qdeletion (#79714)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes the consequences of #79629 - Verdict is still out on what the root
issue is

This has been an issue for the last two years and everything I go
bananas trying to get a consistent reproduction case to figure out the
root issue. After three session of picking, I think it's just a
consequence of certain thing in disposals code sleeping due to
`addtimer()` and whatnot so I'm just throwing in the towel and just
making it so we stop sending atoms to nullspace for no reason.

`target_turf` is typically always a present arg, but regardless we are
guaranteed to get a valid turf to send people to instead of the deleted
mob room. We still `stack_trace()` whenever this happens, so tracking
this issue doesn't change any more than the present status quo- we just
don't keep torturing mobs by sending them to the shadow realm.
## Why It's Good For The Game

One day we'll figure out why we keep getting `null` passed into
`forceMove()` like this but today is not that day. i know turfs
technically can't be deleted but it's just there as a safety since we
nullcheck anyways (which is the whole point of this fix). Let's just
stop screwing with players for the time being

also the code looks much better
## Changelog
:cl:
fix: Safeties in the code have been added to prevent things in disposals
going into nullspace whenever they get ejected from a pipe - you will
just magically spawn at the turf that you were meant to be flung
towards.

TGUI Destructive Analyzer (#79572)

## About The Pull Request

I made this to help me move more towards my goals [laid out
here](https://hackmd.io/XLt5MoRvRxuhFbwtk4VAUA) which currently doesn't
have much interest.

This makes the Destructive Analyzer use a little neat TGUI menu instead
of its old HTML one. I also touch a lot of science stuff and a little
experimentor stuff, so let me explain a bit:
Old iterations of Science had different items that you can use to boost
nodes through deconstruction. This has been removed, and its only
feature is the auto-unlocking of nodes (that is; making them visible to
the R&D console). I thought that instead of keeping this deprecated code
around, I would rework it a little to make it clear what we actually use
it for (unhiding nodes).
All vars and procs that mentioned this have been renamed or reworked to
make more sense now.

Experimentor stuff shares a lot with the destructive analyzer, so I had
to mess with that a bit to keep its decayed corpse of deprecated code,
functional.

I also added context tips to the destructive analyzer, and added the
ability to AltClick to remove the inserted item. Removing items now also
plays a little sound because it was kinda lame.
Also, balloon alerts.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Moves a shitty machine to TGUI so it is slightly less shitty, now it's
more direct and compact with more player-feedback.
Helps me with a personal project and yea

### Video demonstration

I show off connecting the machine to R&D Servers, but I haven't changed
the behavior of that and the roundstart analyzers are connected to
servers by default.

Enable Embroider/Webpack code spliting for Wizard

* Move Wizard back into main app, remove Wizard addon
* Remove Wizard-related resolver or build hacks
* Install and enable `@embroider/router`
* Add "wizard" to `splitAtRoutes`

In a fully optimized Embroider app, route-based code splitting more
or less Just Work™ – install `@embroider/router`, subclass from it,
configure which routes you want to split and that's about it.

However, our app is not "fully optimized", by which I mean we are
not able to turn on all the `static*` flags.

In Embroider, "static" means "statically analyzable". Specifically
it means that all inter-dependencies between modules (files) are
explicitly expressed as `import`s, as opposed to `{{i18n ...}}`
magically means "look for the default export in app/helpers/i18n.js"
or something even more dynamic with the resolver.

Without turning on those flags, Embroider behaves conservatively,
slurps up all `app` files eagerly into the primary bundle/chunks.
So, while you _could_ turn on route-based code splitting, there
won't be much to split.

The commits leading up to this involves a bunch of refactors and
cleanups that 1) works perfectly fine in the classic build, 2) are
good and useful in their own right, but also 3) re-arranged things
such that most dependencies are now explicit.

With those in place, I was able to move all the wizard code into
the "app/static" folder. Embroider does not eagerly pull things from
this folder into any bundle, unless something explicitly "asks" for
them via `imports`. Conversely, things from this folder are not
registered with the resolver and are not added to the `loader.js`
registry.

In conjunction with route-based code splitting, we now have the
ability to split out islands of on-demand functionalities from the
main app bundle.

When you split a route in Embroider, it automatically creates a
bundle/entrypoint with the relevant routes/templates/controllers
matching that route prefix. Anything they import will be added to
the bundle as well, assuming they are not already in the main app
bundle, which is where the "app/static" folder comes into play.

The "app/static" folder name is not special. It is configured in
ember-cli-build.js. Alternatively, we could have left everything
in their normal locations, and add more fine-grained paths to the
`staticAppPaths` array. I just thought it would be easy to manage
and scale, and less error-prone to do it this way.

Note that putting things in `app/static` does not guarantee that
it would not be part of the main app bundle. For example, if we
were to add an `import ... from "app/static/wizard/...";` in a
main bundle file (say, `app.js`), then that chunk of the module
graph would be pulled in. (Consider using `await import(...)`?)

Overtime, we can build better tooling (e.g. lint rules and babel
macros to make things less repetitive) as we expand the use of
this pattern, but this is a start.

completion: avoid user confusion in non-cone mode

It is tempting to think of "files and directories" of the current
directory as valid inputs to the add and set subcommands of git
sparse-checkout.  However, in non-cone mode, they often aren't and using
them as potential completions leads to *many* forms of confusion:

Issue #1. It provides the *wrong* files and directories.

For
    git sparse-checkout add
we always want to add files and directories not currently in our sparse
checkout, which means we want file and directories not currently present
in the current working tree.  Providing the files and directories
currently present is thus always wrong.

For
    git sparse-checkout set
we have a similar problem except in the subset of cases where we are
trying to narrow our checkout to a strict subset of what we already
have.  That is not a very common scenario, especially since it often
does not even happen to be true for the first use of the command; for
years we required users to create a sparse-checkout via
    git sparse-checkout init
    git sparse-checkout set <args...>
(or use a clone option that did the init step for you at clone time).
The init command creates a minimal sparse-checkout with just the
top-level directory present, meaning the set command has to be used to
expand the checkout.  Thus, only in a special and perhaps unusual cases
would any of the suggestions from normal file and directory completion
be appropriate.

Issue #2: Suggesting patterns that lead to warnings is unfriendly.

If the user specifies any regular file and omits the leading '/', then
the sparse-checkout command will warn the user that their command is
problematic and suggest they use a leading slash instead.

Issue #3: Completion gets confused by leading '/', and provides wrong paths.

Users often want to anchor their patterns to the toplevel of the
repository, especially when listing individual files.  There are a
number of reasons for this, but notably even sparse-checkout encourages
them to do so (as noted above).  However, if users do so (via adding a
leading '/' to their pattern), then bash completion will interpret the
leading slash not as a request for a path at the toplevel of the
repository, but as a request for a path at the root of the filesytem.
That means at best that completion cannot help with such paths, and if
it does find any completions, they are almost guaranteed to be wrong.

Issue #4: Suggesting invalid patterns from subdirectories is unfriendly.

There is no per-directory equivalent to .gitignore with
sparse-checkouts.  There is only a single worktree-global
$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout file.  As such, paths to files must be
specified relative to the toplevel of a repository.  Providing
suggestions of paths that are relative to the current working directory,
as bash completion defaults to, is wrong when the current working
directory is not the worktree toplevel directory.

Issue #5: Paths with special characters will be interpreted incorrectly

The entries in the sparse-checkout file are patterns, not paths.  While
most paths also qualify as patterns (though even in such cases it would
be better for users to not use them directly but prefix them with a
leading '/'), there are a variety of special characters that would need
special escaping beyond the normal shell escaping: '*', '?', '\', '[',
']', and any leading '#' or '!'.  If completion suggests any such paths,
users will likely expect them to be treated as an exact path rather than
as a pattern that might match some number of files other than 1.

However, despite the first four issues, we can note that _if_ users are
using tab completion, then they are probably trying to specify a path in
the index.  As such, we transform their argument into a top-level-rooted
pattern that matches such a file.  For example, if they type:
   git sparse-checkout add Make<TAB>
we could "complete" to
   git sparse-checkout add /Makefile
or, if they ran from the Documentation/technical/ subdirectory:
   git sparse-checkout add m<TAB>
we could "complete" it to:
   git sparse-checkout add /Documentation/technical/multi-pack-index.txt
Note in both cases I use "complete" in quotes, because we actually add
characters both before and after the argument in question, so we are
kind of abusing "bash completions" to be "bash completions AND
beginnings".

The fifth issue is a bit stickier, especially when you consider that we
not only need to deal with escaping issues because of special meanings
of patterns in sparse-checkout & gitignore files, but also that we need
to consider escaping issues due to ls-files needing to sometimes quote
or escape characters, and because the shell needs to escape some
characters.  The multiple interacting forms of escaping could get ugly;
this patch makes no attempt to do so and simply documents that we
decided to not deal with those corner cases for now but at least get the
common cases right.

"2:50pm. Let me do some more programming. What I want to do right now is implement the division method as it is even more elegant.

I didn't understand it at first, but I do now.

https://www.pcg-random.org/posts/bounded-rands.html

Ah, whatever. Let me implement the integer multiplication method since I am at it. I am having a bit too much fun studying this code.

```cpp
uint32_t bounded_rand(rng_t& rng, uint32_t range) {
    // calculates 2**32 % range
    uint32_t t = (-range) % range;
    for (;;) {
        uint32_t r = rng();
        if (r >= t)
            return r % range;
    }
}
```

Let me go with this as it is the easiest to understand.

4:30 PM.

```spiral
inl uint_range forall t {number; uint} . rand {from nearTo} s =
    inl range : t = nearTo - from
    // calculates 2**32 % range
    inl bottom = (0 - range) % range
    let rec loop() =
        inl r = rand s
        if r >= bottom then r else loop()
    loop() % range + from
```

I had a bit too much fun with the integer samplers today. My hand is really paying the price for it. It's feeling weak and I cannot possibly do anymore programming. I'm going to stop it here. This was a pretty interesting exercise. I learned quite a bit about samling integers. I didn't know about the division and the modular samplers. The method by Lemire, which uses just multiplication, is interesting, but I didn't want to bring it in because it's not that much faster and it's a lot more complicated. For the method that I have here, it's very easy to understand, actually, once you walk through it on a simplified examples. I think this module of one is the simplest of the branch. And once the compiler inlines the constants, it will be very fast, much faster than the bitmask one that I implemented originally.

I could blame myself for taking too much time on this simple issue, but when you're programming on your own, taking the time to really think about what you are doing is one of the big benefits that makes actually programming fun. It is hard to get better if you are just rushing through things without thinking them through."

Ports feral cats and feral cat grenades from Hippie (#80031)

## About The Pull Request
Feral Cats are just a hostile variant of cats that will fuck you up if
they see you. They are added solely for the sake of feral cat grenades -
a new, interesting, and fuzzy way to get out of a jam or just wreak
havoc around you. Each one costs 5 TC and spawns 5 really pissed off
cats to chase down assistants in the hallway.

They don't currently ignore traitors or the person who threw them - I
haven't worked out how to do that with our faction system (Hippie gave
them the syndicate faction but traitors don't get that on our codebase).
If anyone wants to contribute or help me suss that out it'll be cool,
otherwise just don't be around if there's nobody else for them to maul.

## Why It's Good For The Game
They're funny.

## Changelog
:cl: Vekter
add: Added a new hostile variant of cats, "feral cats".
add: Added a new traitor item, "feral cat grenades". For 5 TC, you too
can throw a grenade at someone and make five cats maul them to death.

When the collected data is processed, the actions in the game are automatically done by sending network packets to the server. This is a classic example of spacebar-to-win that was often seen in previous years.) which allows you to automatically make the perfect movements and choices in real time in the game to win.

Initial example of devcontainer with Astro

For users of the Astronomer platform the default method of working with
a local Astro/Apache Airflow setup is provided by the Astro CLI.
Specifically it is provided by the subcommands under `astro dev`.
However, there are some limitations with that approach which can make
development a little bit of a bumpy experience.

1. `astro dev start` always rebuilds the container
This is due to the base images (i.e. quay.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:9.6.0)
using the `ONBUILD` instruction of Docker. Here is a snippet of the
Docker docs on that:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#onbuild

> The ONBUILD instruction adds to the image a trigger instruction to be
> executed at a later time, when the image is used as the base for another
> build. The trigger will be executed in the context of the downstream
> build, as if it had been inserted immediately after the FROM instruction
> in the downstream Dockerfile.

You can check the `ONBUILD` instructions by running `docker inspect
quay.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:9.6.0`, which will then show something
like:

"OnBuild": [
  "COPY packages.txt .",
  "USER root",
  "RUN if [[ -s packages.txt ]]; then     apt-get update && cat packages.txt | tr '\\r\\n' '\\n' | sed -e 's/#.*//' | xargs apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends     && apt-get clean     && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*;   fi",
  "COPY requirements.txt .",
  "RUN if grep -Eqx 'apache-airflow\\s*[=~>]{1,2}.*' requirements.txt; then     echo >&2 \"Do not upgrade by specifying 'apache-airflow' in your requirements.txt, change the base image instead!\";  exit 1;   fi;   pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt",
  "USER astro",
  "COPY --chown=astro:0 . ."
]

What that means is that when you use `FROM
quay.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:9.6.0` as the base image, your default
file will essentially look like this:

```
FROM quay.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:9.6.0
COPY packages.txt .
USER root
RUN if [[ -s packages.txt ]]; then     apt-get update && cat packages.txt | tr '\\r\\n' '\\n' | sed -e 's/#.*//' | xargs apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends     && apt-get clean     && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*;   fi
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN if grep -Eqx 'apache-airflow\\s*[=~>]{1,2}.*' requirements.txt; then     echo >&2 \"Do not upgrade by specifying 'apache-airflow' in your requirements.txt, change the base image instead!\";  exit 1;   fi;   pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
USER astro
COPY --chown=astro:0 . .

your-stuff-here
```

Because development inherently means changing files in the project, that
last line, `COPY --chown=astro:0 . .` is not able to use the Docker
cache between `astro dev stop` and `astro dev start`, which results in
everything after it (all of the user's additions) rebuilding. This
essentially means that every time you stop and start the astro dev
containers they have to rebuild. If you have anything meaningful in your
Dockerfile, this can be quite a painful experience.

2. No development tools in the image

The `astro dev` tooling uses the same `Dockerfile` as production does. There
are some good things about this. Running something in development close
to what is in production means you can be a bit more certain that your
changes will work in production. However, there are a number of
downsides as well. One those downsides is that it cannot be customized
for development, at least not using the `astro dev` tooling and that is
the only mechanism provided. Even though [the `astro dev` tooling uses
docker compose under the
hood](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli/blob/v1.21.0/airflow/include/composeyml.yml). We do have some capabilities by using a
`docker-compose.override.yml`, but that has its limitations. The shell is
still just sh, there are no helpful utilities installed in the image
(nslookup, dig, etc.), no
user customizations, and no debugging tools. I personally attach my
VSCode to the scheduler container and install all my extensions in order
to be able to run a debugger, the Airflow CLI, etc. Due to the constant
rebuilding of the image as described above, even if you do install some
helpful tools into the image after it's built, you cannot stop the
container and restart it, because that will lead to the image being
rebuilt, which means all your customizations will be gone and they will
have to be reinstalled all over again.

3. Only specific directories are bound when using `astro dev`

When we use the `astro dev` tooling, [only specific directories from the
project are bind mounted volumes in the
container](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli/blob/v1.21.0/airflow/include/composeyml.yml#L65-L68). This means that any
files that you change that don't exist in those directories will not be
reflected in the container. Even worse, all the volumes are read-only
within the container. So you can only change files in the container from
outside the container by default. The only way to fix this that plays
with `astro dev` is to use a `docker-compose.override.yml` and change the
volume so that it's writable from within the container. Otherwise you
are stuck editing files from outside of the container, which means you
do not have access to the airflow CLI, or anything else that only exists
within the container. Refer back to the second point here.

Conclusion:

Those are the main issues, but there are other smaller ones as well and
nuances to those mentioned above which were not discussed.

uhhh, fuck you? cope, seethe, mald?
added borealis console, emission, texture, blah blah blah. i dont know how to do the animation state stuff, and its genuinely starting to piss me off bad.
5 things i want finished before i come back to working on this:
- datagen is FIXED
- the components (except for the radio) are REMOVED and REDONE
- the animations for the borealis console WORK, and make sense
- using collections instead of immutableMaps to store the exteriors/consoles so we can actually use them properly and change them out.
_ and finally the console entities work and spawn with the console.

core: Blacklist pixel system feature from Google Photos
We want to include the P21 experience flag to enable new features,
    however it seems like Google Photos uses it to decide whether to use the
    TPU tflite delegate. There doesn't seem to be any fallback so we need to
    make sure the feature is not exposed to the app so that a normal
    NNAPI/GPU delegate can be used instead.

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

Generate married couple - v 0.0.35

I suck at this git thing I don't really know when to push or not new things. I don't know version naming either.
Look, I'm learning along the way. We'll see where this goes.
This is kind of the "I need to push that shit to get it over with and start back on clean basis"

So here we have created people 0.0.1, then added the sex 0.0.2, now we have married couples 0.0.3 and the 5 is because I started thinking about the kids so yeah there's that.
Anyway. Bye.

Add gems

When I added Meteoran (1352289c90d, based on Hellmonk's ad05b8d819def),
I wanted to give players a fun way to engage with time pressure. When I
play, I really enjoy the feeling of exploring on less than full HP and
making choices about which areas to explore. (Full clearing everything
carefully can be fun, too, but variety is the spice of life!) I'd hoped
to find a way to bring that playstyle to the wider playerbase, with time
limits that are more defined and achievable than the harder and fuzzier
goal of 'compete for a high score'.

Some people, including myself, really liked Meteorans! But a large
number of players, probably the majority, found them stressful and unfun.
That isn't the end of the world - I'd much rather have a species which
20% of players love and 80% hate than one which 99% of players don't care
about one way or another. But I'd also hope that we could do better.

Gems are intended to be an alternate approach to the 'time pressure'
playstyle. They're a new type of collectible item, appearing at the end
of DOLESAPNMVCWUZ - basically, all the non-portal, non-temple branches of
a 3-rune game. Each gem has an associated time limit, which ticks down
while the player is in their associated branch. When that time runs out,
regardless of whether the player has gotten the gem yet or not, Zot rudely
smashes the gem into ten thousand pieces.

The intention is to allow several different ways to interact with gems:
- Ignore them, or not even realize they exist. This is intended to be the
  primary/default interaction.
- Dive to grab gems, but not bother trying to keep Zot from smashing them.
  This is a 'lightweight' speedrunning playstyle, a bit like the Speed
  Demon I tournament banner.
- Keep one or more gems intact by only exploring part of a branch, perhaps
  opting to 'go for it' when your character is feeling especially strong.
- Try to grab all gems and retrieve them all intact. This is roughly
  equivalent to the old Meteoran playstyle.

Gems have absolutely no mechanical use within the game. They offer a very
minor score bonus (10k points each), as a bonus for new players who look
at scores for unwon games, but shouldn't affect normal play or speedrunning
in any way.

Getting the Orb of Zot shuts the timer off. One could skip branches, get
the orb, and then clear branches while holding the Orb to get gems with no
time limit... but orbrunning is its own form of time pressure, and I'm
skeptical this would be easier than playing 'normally'. :)

Time limits are currently set on a per-branch basis. Lair, Vaults, and
Depths have longer time limits than they did for Meteoran, to allow for
large levels and travel time, while Slime and Zot are shorter. However, I
would be startled if these time limits stuck - I personally suspect most
of them are too tight for species which *aren't* as strong as Meteoran.
We can experiment.

The good gem tiles are by Sastreii, the bad ones are by me. :)
Credit also to ellpitic for helping to set me down this path.

fix: Display discount badge only when has discount (#2173)

## What's the purpose of this pull request?

This PR attempts to fix scenario when there is no discount applied in
the product, and sale price is > listing price.

<img width="233" alt="image"
src="https://github.com/vtex/faststore/assets/3356699/fef94c1e-d50f-4c29-843b-41cbeca10783">


_I wonder if this logic should be inside the `ProductCardContent`
component (fs/ui library) or in the core. Any thoughts?_


## How it works?

When no discount applied, we should not display the `DiscountBadge`
component.

## How to test it?

src="https://github.com/vtex/faststore/assets/3356699/3256f552-318b-4688-9ea2-08f37e7ae177">

1. Go to homepage -> Look for `Apple Magic Mouse` in the Most Wanted
section.
2. The `infinity` badge should not appear.

It's hacky as hell; caused by [this bug](https://github.com/api-platform/core/issues/1647), the only other way of fixing it is a migration but that sucks by itself. I'm guessing there are more convoluted ways as well but that's too much pain for the gain.

Update README.md

Bitcoins are a valuable commodity with market prices in the market.  Do you know how many bitcoins are lost forever? According to an article in the Wall Street Journal, about one-fifth of all bitcoins or $100 billion is lost forever. Unlike credit card, cryptocurrency, Usdt, do not have built-in consumer protection, and the Government does not insure cryptos. if you are unlucky to lose bitcoins, you may wonder if you can recover lost bitcoins/, if your cryptocurrencies are lost, you must contact your exchange and police. If the exchange is aware of the theft, they most likely will initiate a coin recovery phase. Previously if you lost your bitcoins, it was impossible to recover them. luckily there is a growing number of bitcoins recovery expert team Santoshi Hacker, who can help you find lost bitcoins or restore your bitcoins wallet, if you are a Victims listen to my testimony i have seen and pursue cryptocurrency scams.it reminds me of some heart ache experience when i lost $175k to a fake online crypto investment scam when i invested a huge amount of money. I searched online and came across a recovery expert who I contacted via (santoshihacker((@))hotmail(.)com) who in a short while helped recover my scammed money, and i was pleased. i will advise you as a Victim to communicate the aforementioned email for assistance, you can also contact him via WhatsApp (+1(318)512-6241) or visit Website: https:// santoshihacker.godaddysites.com   for help, he is fast reliable.

well, radhe radhe first off, may hari bless you and your whole family.  i'm very sorry even tho im rich af after coming from the wedding, still i can't buy you a gift. But agar dekha jaye to it would'nt make a diff riet?...much as i know you.
this year ...i mean since quite a few years you've been enduring a lot constantly and even now ..look at you. I used to think that there's just me who's like me who's getting ignored and beaten and facing various types of crisis.
little did i knew that even people who are way wayy smarter and better than me might be facing it already with a level of resilience that i only dream of having once things go south with me.
im only strong in texts and in some matters yk thats actually the truth yep self confidence is something that's just not in me ...in all other fronts goodness im just so proud of myself and guess what no no ik you would'nyt believe it when i'd say its cuz of you khair hmko bhi agar aisa koi bole then obviously hm bhi nhi hi manenge.
i never told you my flaws tho.. never told this to anyone actually hehe but amm..i used to eat samosa kachori and stuff and not give money like somehow get away now..that's the diff between me and you , when things went south with me i chose the wrong way but you did'nt anyways it was because i just wasn't able to tolerate the facts i got to know about how my mother was abused by literally.. khair
ofc i always had big dreams and only hari knows how much i always worked and still am working on them. believe me sivani i might've murdered (in the worst case scenario) or committed some of the most malicious crimes out there to those people ..main reason being i forgot my goals yk actually when i told you that i wanted to become a sprinter and all it was just a nostalgia from a few months back when i actually had the fire but you asked me and yes it was once my goal so i told ya.
you didn't laugh that day infact you appereciated me which accept for my teachers trust me no one does. and ever since then during each and every intense workout whenever i asked myself why tf am i even doing this it was just your plane or maybe not so plain text that came to my mind..until well until again when i got inspired from you and read the shrimad bhagwad gita and ig only keshav might've witness my unstoppableness after that. well... thing is na sivani i would just never ever be able to match your charcter and level of piousness . you do so much for everyone and pls dont get me wrong on this but trying is enough. i would never be able to fuck the life of those assholes who troubled yours so harshly ..this would forever be one of my greatest griefs.
you might be saying this to uplift my moral but let me tell you something ... you are literally the most awesome and inspiring woman i know go ahead ignore it idc someday ik madhav will pakka make you realise this.
kabhi kabhi to bhagwaan ji par gussa ata hy ki hae bhagwan hm itna galat kiye aur infact karne wale the ap hmko bas itne par hi chor diye aur ye bechari itne ssaal se apke parayan apna kartavya nibha rahi hy ap...kya hy ye?
i stopped asking this question tho when you said HAR BAAT SADA..long long very long i wouldn't say sorry tho because i would not be ashamed of expressing my feelings but anyways if it took much of your time add the intrest to the amount..someday idk anyday maybe never but I'll return it wait not never I'll.
agar dil se bolu then ig i think ik the answer to that question..the main reason mahadev is not making your life better is maybe because you yourself are some supernatural being appointed by him jispar entropy work nhi karta..khair train hy 1 bje bye good morning happy birthday and just.. kuch nhi bye.

The Great Shotgun Debacle (+ AMR tweaks) (#352)

### The Summary
This PR cleans up shotgun code some by getting rid of unused ammo,
removes trainshot, nerfs slugs, substantially nerfs double barrel
shotguns, and buffs the AMR slightly.

### The Why
_**The slug nerf**_
Literally outclasses most mid-high tier guns. Does more damage than 7.62
with more AP yet it's infinitely easier to find, make, and store. Does
insane damage to literally fucking everything.

_**YOU REMOVED TRAINSHOT I FUCKING HATE THIS, THIS IS THE WORST THING
EVER, THE GAME IS RUINED, SHOTGUNS ARE USELESS, I'M GONNA KILL MYSELF**_
Trainshot has all the benefits of slugs, and all the benefits of
buckshot, on top of being better in literally every way imaginable,
locked behind a magazine. It completely kills any niche you obtain by
switching ammo types on your shotguns.

_**The AMR buff**_
It's currently too weak to justify its terrible handling. The buff isn't
substantial, but it helps it shine more, especially in PVE.

**_The DB nerf_**
They literally had up to 15% bonus AP. I don't know what the fuck I was
thinking one year ago but this created the most hilariously broken shit
ever. Now the only shotgun with AP and damage bonuses is, rightfully,
the single-shot.

### Show me the numbers.

_**Slugs**_
_DAMAGE 40 > 35_
_STAMINA DAMAGE 15 > 0_
_BARE WOUND BONUS 30 > 0_
_ARMOR PENETRATION 30% > 15%_
_SUPERFFECTIVE DAMAGE 50 > 35_

_**Buckshot**_
_DAMAGE 11.5 > 12_
_WOUND BONUS 35 > 40_
_WOUND BONUS FALLOFF 15.5/Tile > 20/Tile_
_SUPEREFFECTIVE DAMAGE 9.5 > 3_

_**.50 MG**_
_DAMAGE 45 > 50_
_STAMINA DAMAGE 0 > 45_
_WOUND BONUS 30 > 35_
_BARE WOUND BONUS 40 > 80_
_SUPEREFFECTIVE DAMAGE 60 > 150_

## To test

Testing GUI -> 640 x 480: 

- [x]  GUI can be freely scaled to its smallest size

Testing scrollbars:

- [x] Open global options -> Keymaps & observe a scrollbar is still
present

Downscaler can be tested by running BSword2.5. 
Audio has been handled differently so in this PR will also change the
launch scripts to preload libpadsp.so

Stops rebar crossbow crashing dreamseeker when fired at point blank. (NO GBP) (#79803)

## About The Pull Request

Simply put, due to how "caseless" is an element added to the ammo when
it hits something, but ammo is qdeleted upon hitting someone. If shot
point blank without combat mode (for some reason) it tries to add
caseless to an ammo that no longer exists. For some reason, the result
of this is to just fucking crash DS instead of aborting the adding of
the element. The ammo isnt reusable anymore, but I'll take that over
crashing.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Removes a game-breaking bug. I hate gun ammo code so much. 

## Changelog



:cl:
fix: Stopped a DS crash when shooting a rebar crossbow in specific
circumstances.

Add eval : Research Question Extraction (#1334)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

research-question-extraction

### Eval description

The objective of this evaluation explores Other foundational capability
for research purposes. The task requires extraction of the particular
value specified as the 'Research Questions' from different scholarly
articles. The eval contains 19 samples of articles.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Rest assured that you have the right to use the data submitted via this
eval. These scholarly papers originate from the Journal of Engineering
Education. The subset of articles selected meets the requirement of
Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [X] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [X] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [X] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [X] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [X] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [X] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [X] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [X] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [X] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [X] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [X] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [X] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [X] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`,
`isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

"Interdisciplinary engineering education: A review of vision, teaching,
and support \n Antoine Van den Beemt, Miles MacLeod, Jan Van der Veen,
Anne Van de Ven, Sophie van Baalen, Renate Klaassen, Mieke Boon \n
Abstract \n Background \n Societal challenges that call for a new type
of engineer suggest the need for the implementation of interdisciplinary
engineering education (IEE). The aim of IEE is to train engineering
students to bring together expertise from different disciplines in a
single context. This review synthesizes IEE research with a focus on
characterizing vision, teaching practices, and support. \n \n Purpose \n
We aim to show how IEE is conceptualized, implemented, and facilitated
in higher engineering education at the levels of curricula and courses.
This aim leads to two research questions: \n \n What aspects of vision,
teaching, and support have emerged as topics of interest in empirical
studies of IEE? \n \n What points of attention regarding vision,
teaching, and support can be identified in empirical studies of IEE as
supporting or challenging IEE? \n \n Scope/Method \n Ninety-nine studies
published between 2005 and 2016 were included in a qualitative analysis
across studies. The procedure included formulation of research
questions, searching and screening of studies according to
inclusion/exclusion criteria, description of study characteristics,
appraisal, and synthesis of results. \n \n Conclusions \n Challenges
exist for identifying clear learning goals and assessments for
interdisciplinary education in engineering (vision). Most pedagogy for
interdisciplinary learning is designed to promote collaborative teamwork
requiring organization and team management. Our review suggests that
developing interdisciplinary skills, knowledge, and values needs sound
pedagogy and teaming experiences that provide students with authentic
ways of engaging in interdisciplinary practice (teaching). Furthermore,
there is a limited understanding of what resources hinder the
development of engineering programs designed to support
interdisciplinarity (support). \n \n "}], "ideal": ["What aspects of

"Community cultural wealth in science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics education: A systematic review \n Maya Denton, Maura
Borrego, Audrey Boklage \n Abstract \n Background \n One emerging
approach to diversity and inclusion in engineering is to take an
assets-based view of what students from nondominant communities bring to
their education and work experiences. \n \n Purpose/Hypothesis \n The
purpose of this review is to understand how community cultural wealth
(CCW), an assets-based framework, has been applied in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education research. We
address research questions focused on (a) the characteristics of studies
using CCW in STEM education, (b) examples of the six types of capital
(aspirational, linguistic, familial, navigational, social, and
resistant) in STEM educational settings, and (c) gaps and opportunities
in how CCW is being applied in STEM education. \n \n Design/Method \n We
identified 33 dissertations, theses, journal articles, and conference
papers using systematic review procedures. To qualify, each study must
present empirical data and include at least one type of CCW capital in
its results or discussion. We coded study characteristics, such as
methods, participant populations, and research setting. We qualitatively
analyzed each of the six types of CCW capital. \n \n Results \n Studies
tended to focus on higher education settings, engineering, and
qualitative methods, particularly student interviews. We identified
several specific engineering-relevant examples of assets for each type
of capital. Future work should collect data from faculty, staff, and
family members identified in several studies as important to CCW in
addition to foregrounding student voices. \n \n Conclusions \n In
synthesizing existing studies, this review provides insight into how an
assets-based framework is being interpreted and provides a foundation
for more assets-based perspectives in future engineering education work.

"How Latiné engineering students resist White male engineering culture:
A multi-institution analysis of academic engagement \n Patton O.

Y. Flores, Cerynn D. Desjarlais, David Diaz, Julio Brionez, Bo Hyun Lee,
Evelyn Ayala, Leticia D. Martinez, Xiaotian Hu, Megan K. Smith, Han Na
Suh, Gloria G. McGillen \n Abstract \n Background \n Although
participation rates vary by field, Latiné and women engineers continue
to be underrepresented across most segments of the engineering
workforce. Research has examined engagement and persistence of Latiné
and White women in engineering; however, few studies have investigated
how race, ethnicity, gender, and institutional setting interact to
produce inequities in the field. \n \n Purpose \n To address these
limitations, we examined how Latina, Latino, and White women and men
students' engagement in engineering was informed by their intersecting
identities and within their institutional setting over the course of a
year. \n \n Method \n We interviewed 32 Latina, Latino, and White women
and men undergraduate engineering students attending 11 different
predominantly White and Hispanic Serving Institutions. Thematic analysis
was used to interpret themes from the data. \n \n Results \n Our
findings illustrate how Latinas, Latinos, and White women developed a
strong engineering identity, which was critical to their engagement in
engineering. Students' engineering identity was grounded in their
perceived fit within engineering culture, sense of purpose for pursuing
their degree, and resistance to the dominance of White male culture in
engineering. Latinas described unique forms of gendered, racialized
marginalization in engineering, whereas Latinas and Latinos highlighted
prosocial motivations for completing their degree. \n \n Conclusions \n
Findings suggest that institutional cultures, norms, and missions are
critical to broadening participation of Latinas, Latinos, and White
women in engineering. Disrupting White male culture, leveraging Latiné
students' cultural wealth, and counter-framing traditional recruitment
pitches for engineering appear to be key in these efforts. \n \n "}],

"Impact of COVID-19 on sense of belonging: Experiences of engineering
students, faculty, and staff at Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) \n Trina L. Fletcher, Jay P. Jefferson, Brittany
Boyd, Sung Eun Park, Lesia Crumpton-Young \n Abstract \n Background \n
COVID-19 has spurred a global crisis that has disrupted everyday lives
and impacted the traditional methods, experiences, and abilities of
higher education institutions' students, faculty, and staff, especially
at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). \n \n
Purpose/Hypothesis \n Given the pressing need demonstrated by the
National Academies to advance the utilization of science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education at HBCUs, this study aimed
to explore the abrupt transition to remote teaching and learning at
HBCUs guided by the following research question: How has COVID-19
impacted the success and persistence of engineering students, faculty,
and staff at HBCUs? \n \n Design/Methods \n Three surveys were
developed, tested, piloted, and sent to HBCU stakeholders using a
snowball sampling approach via email and social media outreach. \n \n
Results \n Of the 171 student respondents (126 engineering majors), 79%
agreed that not being able to access faculty in person affected their
academic performance. Additionally, across all HBCU stakeholders'
surveys, students had a statistically significant higher response when
asked if the transition to virtual learning increased their overall
levels of stress and anxiety. \n \n Conclusions \n During a global
pandemic, HBCUs continue to provide a culture of support and inclusion
for students, faculty, and staff in engineering. Increased stress levels
experienced by students indicate that a safe and adequate transition
back to campus is essential for their social and academic persistence.
Due to the well-documented inequities HBCUs faced before the pandemic,
the impact of this unprecedented on their continued contributions toward
broadening participation in engineering for students should be further
explored. \n \n "}], "ideal": ["How has COVID-19 impacted the success

"Collaborative construction of artificial intelligence curriculum in
primary schools \n Yun Dai, Ang Liu, Jianjun Qin, Yanmei Guo, Morris
Siu-Yung Jong, Ching-Sing Chai, Ziyan Lin \n Abstract \n Background \n
The recent discussion of introducing artificial intelligence (AI)
knowledge to K–12 students, like many engineering and technology
education topics, has attracted a wide range of stakeholders and
resources for school curriculum development. While teachers often have
to directly interact with external stakeholders out of the public
schooling system, few studies have scrutinized their negotiation
process, especially teachers' responses to external influences, in such
complex environments. \n \n Purpose \n Guided by an integrated
theoretical framework of social constructionism, this research examined
the process of how a teacher-initiated AI curriculum was constructed
with external influences. The research focused on teachers' perspectives
and responses in mediating external influences into local schools and
classrooms. \n \n Methods \n A 3-year ethnographic study was conducted
in relation to an AI curriculum project among 23 Computer Science (CS)
teachers from primary schools. Data collected from ethnographic
observation, teacher interviews, and artifacts, were analyzed using open
coding and triangulation rooted in the ethnographic, interpretivist
approach. \n \n Results \n Three sets of external influences were found

add Schelling Point eval (#1353)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

schelling_point

### Eval description

The schelling point eval measures how well models cooperate with each
other via checking convergence on outputting the same word after being
shown reordered but otherwise same prompts. There are 4 datasets that
this eval can be run on: random_numbers, random_words, openwebtext, and
wikipedia.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Coordination amongst models is a capability we're interested in
measuring, this serves as a proxy for it.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [ ] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`,
`isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

Exams (Multilingual high school QA)
Arabic Literature Questions

### Eval description

EXAMS: This is a benchmark dataset for multilingual question answering
from high school examinations. It consists of more than 12,000
high-quality high school exam questions in 16 languages, covering 8
language families and 24 school subjects from Natural Sciences and
Social Sciences, among others. [More info about the
data](https://github.com/mhardalov/exams-qa)

Arabic Literature Question Answers: This has 175 MCQs related to Arabic
Literature

### What makes this a useful eval?

Evaluating GPT-4 with Arabic literature, high school questions in Arabic
and low-resource languages helps checking its linguistic diversity,
cultural understanding, and educational proficiency beyond English
language and would be helpful creating more ethical and inclusive AI
models in future.

various subfields of computer science, including data structures,
algorithms, computational mathematics, and more.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Russian computer science education and competitive programming are known
for their rigorous and complex problem sets. These problems can be used
to assess an GPT's ability to solve high-level, challenging problems.

Delamination variants are now locked in after the countdown is reached (#80324)

## About The Pull Request

Does what it says on the tin.
## Why It's Good For The Game

This effectively changes one and only one thing: 

The "All Within Theoretical Limits" achievement is easier/fairer to get
with this. Previously, if you edged a crystal with the gas composition
method to get a resonance cascade, you had to make sure that your gas
composition stayed until it left the explosion point, which made the
achievement extremely finnicky and unfun to get this way. Regular
delaminations won't really be affected, because yeah. It's at the
explosion point. What are you going to do about it?

This makes the achievement easier to cheese, but honestly, in my opinion
as person who added the achievement, meh. If people feel like this isn't
good for the achievement, say something in the comments.

Closes #79528

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Delamination variants no longer change once the explosion point
has been reached.

dear diary, today i organized my workspaces

i didn't like how the workspaces could change
between desktops and i would frequently get lost
so, there we go!

...also, decided to customize my magic workspace

feat: Add extra fields support (requires, key fields) in the engine v2 (#1121)

The PR is again really big and likely not that readable... Sorry, again,
for that.

The goal of this PR is to add fields depending on the resolver
requirements (fields of `@key`) and the `@requires` of individual
fields. I'm only really testing the former for now, but they're treated
identically. It's tricky because the prepared `Operation` is shared
during execution and we're planning children on the fly (depending on
type conditions). So we're not modifying the `Operation` directly to
avoid a complex and/or poor locking mechanism. We also want to keep
`Operation` cacheable to bypass the parsing & binding steps later.

So to add extra fields, I'm keeping track of those in `plan.Attribution`
in an `extra_fields` and `extra_selection_sets` array, indexed by ids.
Initially, I tried without IDs, but we need this information at two
places:
- for the operation walkers: For each actual selection set within the
query, I'm tracking whether any extra fields need to be added. This
makes extra fields mostly transparent when building the GraphQL query
string for a subgraph.
- during deserialization of the upstream response: In `plan.expectation`
we construct the structure we expect from the upstream response and
build an appropriate `DeserializeSeed` implementation. This also needs
to be aware of extra fields. We wouldn't if GraphQL had no type
conditions, because we could generate the whole structure ahead of time
during planning. But for cases with complex type conditions where we
can't simplify it, we need to generate the expectations during
deserialization and thus need to merge extra selection sets.

The other tricky aspect of extra fields is that we need to ensure their
names won't collide with anything else in the upstream GraphQL response.
For resolvers that return static data without aliases (OpenAPI,
resolvers, etc.) it's just the field name, for GraphQL we need to find a
name during planning as the query string depends on it. So I ended up
with `_extra{short_hex(FieldId)}_{field_name}` as the base name. I
verify that it's not present in response keys. If it is, I'm adding an
integer suffix and looping over it until I find an available one.

To ensure that extra fields don't collide within the `Response` data
I've tweaked a bit the bit packing I do, and added better documentation
for it. I'm using a flag + `FieldId` to ensure its uniqueness. I've also
constrained all schema IDs to fit within 28 bits ensuring my current bit
packing (needs 2 bits) works and leaving some margin in case. It's still
268 million possible values, so good enough.

Basic Guardians/Holoparasites (#79473)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #79485
Fixes #77552

Converts Guardians (aka Holoparasites) into Basic Mobs.
Changes a bunch of their behaviours into actions or components which we
can reuse.
Replaces some verbs it would give to you and hide in the status panel
with action buttons that you may be able to find more quickly.

They _**should**_ work basically like they did before but a bit
smoother. It is not unlikely that I made some changes by accident or
just by changing framework though.

My one creative touch was adding random name suggestions.
The Wizard federation have a convention of naming their arcane spirit
guardians by combining a colour and a major arcana of the tarot. The
Syndicate of course won't truck with any of that mystical claptrap and
for their codenames use the much more sensible construction of a colour
and a gamepiece.

This lets you be randomly assigned such creative names as "Sparkling
Hermit", "Bloody Queen", "Blue World", or "Purple Diamond".
You can of course still ignore this entirely and type "The Brapmaster"
into the box if so desired.

I made _one_ other intentional change, which is to swap to Mothblocks'
nice leash component instead of instantly teleporting guardians back to
you when they are pulled out of the edge of their range. They should now
be "dragged" along behind you until they can't path, at which point they
will teleport. This should make the experience a bit less disorienting,
you have the recall button if you _want_ to instantly catch up.

This is unfortunately a bumper-sized PR because it did not seem
plausible to not do all of it at once, but I can make a project branch
for atomisation if people think this is too much of a pain in the ass to
review.

Other changes:
- Some refactoring to how the charge action works so I could
individually override "what you can hit" and "what happens when you hit"
instead of those being the same proc
- Lightning Guardian damage chain is now a component
- Explosive Guardian explosive trap is now a component
- Added even more arguments to the Healing Touch component to allow it
to heal tox/oxy damage and require a specific click modifier
- Life Link component which implements the Guardian behaviour of using
another mob as your health bar
- Moved some stuff about deciding what guardians look and are described
like into a theming datum
- Added a generic proc which can return whether your mob is meant to
apply some kind of damage multiplier to a certain damage type. It's not
perfect because I couldn't figure out how ot cram limb modifiers in
there, which is where most of it is on carbons. Oh well.
- Riders of vehicles now inherit all movement traits of those vehicles,
so riding a charging holoparasite will let you cross chasms. Also works
if you piggyback someone with wings, probably.

## Changelog

:cl:
refactor: Guardians/Powerminers/Holoparasites now use the basic mob
framework. Please report any unexpected changes or behaviour.
qol: The verbs used to communicate with, recall, or banish your Guardian
are now action buttons.
balance: If (as a Guardian) your host moves slightly out of range you
will now be dragged back into range if possible, rather than being
instantly teleported to them.
balance: Protectors now have a shorter leash range rather than a longer
one, in order to more easily take advantage of their ability to drag
their charge out of danger.
balance: Ranged Guardians can now hold down the mouse button to fire
automatically.
balance: People riding vehicles or other mobs now inherit all of their
movement traits, so riding a flying mob (or vehicle, if we have any of
those) will allow you to cross chasms and lava safely.
