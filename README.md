[MDB Ignore] Manifest Destiny - The Final Tile Flattening (#74169)

Alt Title: The End Of The 12 Month War
## About The Pull Request

### Hey! Listen! This PR _will_ cause a merge conflict with your PR!
Please ensure that you have the knowledge on how to handle merge
conflicts, found here:
https://hackmd.io/@tgstation/ry4-gbKH5#Assured-Merge-Conflict-Resolution

Supercedes #74023 entirely.

Port of the tooling introduced in
https://github.com/BeeStation/BeeStation-Hornet/pull/7970 (we already
had everything else), modified to meet /tg/'s requisites and culling
anything that was not entirely relevant (that I could see). It's not the
end of the world if I missed something tbh. Some aspects were commented
out since they may be relevant to downstreams who port this PR or to
enable (what I see to be) un-necessary warnings.

This is a culmination of a year's efforts, starting with _Red Rover,
Four Corners_ (#65290) and later _Opposing Corners_ (#65455). If you
don't understand why this PR exists or why it's necessary, I recommend
reading both of those.

Since then, several mappers (both in their own mapping as well as
tailored PRs) have worked on "flattening" out these tile turfs, however
I've continually wanted a function that would mass automate it (outlined
here https://tgstation13.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=31872 - This
functionality might still be useful if added to UpdatePaths or another
type of script thereof, but I no longer have reason to keep the bounty
up).

It's finally here! Yippie! A new python file, courtesy of itsmeow at
BeeStation. Very awesome. As previously mentioned, a lot of alterations
had to be made for our mapping desires, but the results are quite
agreeable. There's a few assertions that this file makes that I had to
address:

* We have "colorless" tile decals. These are transparent, so they don't
do anything. By default, bee would make these "white tiles", but we have
no such thing. I decided to just add a maplint and an UpdatePaths to
guard against this silliness (only Delta and Tram) had it.
* For some reason, it labels already-converted decals with the default
direction as an error state. I might touch this up in the coming hours,
but for now I surpressed the error due to how many false warnings it was
spitting out.

There's a few ways this tool can be improved, but I lack the knowledge
on how to do so:
* Make it so that we can run the map merger to fix the keys of the map
in the `update_map` function, rather than run the fixer-upper python
file. We can live without this to be honest. It's actually slightly good
because it forces you to look at all of the MapMerge Warnings, and you
can ascertain any potential errors without it silently passing you by
and hitting the repository (or at least those that we haven't linted for
yet).
* Be able to pass in any regex to "flatten" anything. That's way out of
scope for what I want to do here though.

## How do you use this tool?

I made a readme.
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/blob/363852cb17fa46dad8fd20e261f8f665f3e008bb/tools/MapTileAggregator/readme.md
### Mapping March
oh hey it's pretty neat that this PR came out in mapping march, what a
nice qol for mappers as the month enters the home stretch. ckey is
san7890

## Why It's Good For The Game

slimmer DMM files, better mapping practices. cool new tool. so nice.
## Changelog
Nothing that really affects players, but a short summary for all those
reading this PR:

* All "corner" turf decals are flattened, and there's now a tool that we
store that you can re-run to keep stuff flat in case you like mapping
one way and want to fix it at the end.
* We (should) now lint against useless uncolored turf decals since that
was completely garbo as far as our codebase is concerned.
* UpdatePaths for fixing up uncolored turf decals, yippie!


If you want to review this PR, may I suggest the file filter. You don't
need to look at any of the DMM files I already did:

Hologram Touchup (Init savings edition) (#74793)

## About The Pull Request

### Polishes and Reworks Holograms

Hologram generation currently involves a bunch of icon operations, which
are slow.
Not to mention a series of get flats for the human models, which is even
worse.

We lose 0.05 seconds of init to em off just the 2 RCD holograms. it
hurts man.

So instead, let's use filters and render steps to achive the same
effect.

While I'm here I'll dim the holo light and make it blue, make the
hologram and its beam emissive (so they glow), and do some fenangling
with move_hologram() (it doesn't clear the hologram off failure anymore,
instead relying on callers to do that) to ensure holocalls can't be
accidentially ended by moving out of the area.

Ah and I added RESET_ALPHA to the emissive appearance flags, cause the
alpha does override and fuck with color rendering, which ends up looking
dumb. If we're gonna support this stuff it should be first class not
accidential.

### Makes Static Not Shit

While I'm here (since holograms see static) lets ensure the static plane
is always visible if you're seeing through an ai eye.

The old solution was limited to applying it to JUST ais, which isn't
satisfactory for this sort of thing and missed a LOT of cases (I didn't
really get how ai eyes worked before I'ma be honest)

I'm adding a signal off the hud for it detecting a change in its eye
here.
This is semi redundant, but avoids unneeded dupe work, so I'm ok with
it.

The pipeline here is less sane then I'd like, but it works and that's
enough

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Holograms glow now, pokes at the lighting for holocalls in general
a bit to make em nicer.
qol: You can no longer accidentally end a holocall (as a non ai) by
leaving the area. Felt like garbage
fix: Fixes static rendering improperly if viewed by a non ai

Mafia rebalance and backend refactor (#74640)

## About The Pull Request

Turns all Mafia abilities into datums, instead of being a bunch of
shitcode on every single job.
This means it's easier to add new roles
Gives new names to some defines (such as the signal order, to make it
easier to tell when something is fired)
Adds support for modular Mafia jobs with their abilities being in a
certain order (Escort is now properly first).
De-snowflakes Changeling killing abilities and day voting, they're now
actions that are tallied when necessary.

Turns time vars into defines
Generalizes a lot of behavior for abilities, now all abilities can
properly undo their action at night

Fixes problems with the UI (Thoughtfeeder had 2 buttons during night and
they overlapped with names, that's been fixed).

### Behavior changes

- Doctor/Officer can now protect themselves 1 night, because it gives
them a way to protect themselves.
- Lawyer/Warden/Ect now choose their abilities at night, rather than the
day before. The suspense building up towards the end of the night is
part of the game, telling you that it happened at the very start is
quite lame (in the case of Lawyer, anyway).
- Admin setup now uses TGUI instead of html inputs.
- Cut night time by like, 5 seconds, because I found it a little long
lol.
- HoP doesn't count as votes to win until they reveal, because it makes
no sense an unrevealed HoP has their unrevealed votes tallied. I also
like those 1v1 Mayor V. Evil scenarios where dead chat goes crazy, and
hope to replicate that here.
- Mafia now needs 6 people to start instead of 4, because 4 players is
just not enough to play a Mafia round that will do anything but annoy
people.
- The game no longer ends if it's in a standoff with 1 Town, 1 Mafia,
and 1 Neutral, as you've got a kingmaker and they should decide who
wins.

### Things I want to change in the future
Every time night starts/ends, it checks the entire ``GLOB.airlocks`` for
doors with the "mafia" ID. This is stupid.
Rework ``check_victory()`` to make it make more sense, and be more fun
for players.
A visible death animation?
I want to use something similar to admin popup for messages about people
being on stand, and decluttering the UI in general
Also more use of balloon alerts instead of to chat messages for
everything.
Also also, making the UI more responsive to players. Button should be
red when a player is selected, so they know that's who they've selected,
if they want to unselect.
Are votes public when you first cast them? They shouldn't be wtf.
Can we also make the description for roles not be a to chat message? It
can just say when you hover over the '?' come on.
User-written wills instead of auto-generated, and able to send them in
chat
Add support for roleblock-immune roles

## Why It's Good For The Game

Updates a lot of old code to modern standards
Makes it considerably easier to work with Mafia and add new roles
Makes things less prone to breaking as easily.
Code also looks a lot cleaner now.

## Changelog

:cl:
refactor: [Mafia] All Mafia abilities have been overhauled in the
backend, it's now much easier to understand what each role's ability can
do and how it works.
admin: [Mafia] Admin setup of Mafia is now in TGUI
balance: [Mafia] Doctors/Officers can protect themselves once per game.
Be careful around them!
fix: [Mafia] Thoughtfeeder's UI buttons at night won't overlap with
eachother.
fix: [Mafia] HoP's votes now actually matter, instead of being purely
visual.
qol: [Mafia] Lawyers, Wardens, etc. now perform their night ability at
night, instead of the day prior.
qol: [Mafia] Night time now lasts 40 seconds instead of 45.

The two areas of note are the singularity reactor, which is assembled,
and would just need a hand if someone were to want to start it, and the
research lab. The Research lab contains the fruits of the now deceased
science staff's labors, assorted energy weapons. Unfortunately, it also
contains the deceased science staff.

Other areas of the base were not so lucky, and are thoroughly infested

The engineering team attempted to hold back the vines, and quickly
discovered that fire was not sufficient.

And what used to be the recreation area is completely gone

Notably, the hangar is empty. I plan on making a patch to put a
subshuttle inside it once that rolls around.

Notable loot includes:
3 energy SMGs
3 Flamethrowers
The Ion Projector, a self charging Ion weapon.
An Antique Laser
2 Energy PDWs
2 Accelerator Laser Cannons
4 engineering hardsuits
An engineering lathe and circuit imprinter
A particle accelerator
A singularity generator
6 emitters
1 energy shotgun
Kudzu Seeds
Basically Everything You'd Need For an R&D Set Up
A sense of pride and accomplishment



I feel like this has some rough spots but I've got no idea where to
start, so into the review -> testing -> feedback process it goes

- [x] The ruin spawns when the spawn ruin verb doesn't runtime.
## Why It's Good For The Game
More ruin variety. This one spawns in space and does a few things that I
haven't seen yet. Mainly a singularity, cool semi-hidden asteroid base
that could in theory, be turned into a player lair.
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would

[Needs TM] The Accelerataning (#1781)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Gone are the days of spam clicking buttons to move faster in a
direction, with this PR, ships now accelerate constantly (as long as you
have fuel and don't touch the throttle) in a direction you set, leading
to a much smoother flight experience. I imagine it's going to be a bit
tougher to thread gaps, but flying a spaceship *is* quite literally
rocket science. So.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29362068/220281305-12f6b796-9d8a-41ce-84a6-236bb03274da.gif)

Also actually makes the minimum and maximum speed work, and adjusts them
to a more tolerable level.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Eliminates the ability to cheese high speeds by spamming the accelerate
button, and also makes the flight experience much more pleasant as you
don't have to spam click to move a decent speed.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: A new system for ship flight, where you only point a direction and
set the throttle to change your speed, reducing the need for
spam-clicking.
fix: There's now a maximum and minimum speed, 600spm and 0.01spm,
respectively. The limits have been broken all this time.

gpg-interface: set trust level of missing key to "undefined"

In check_signature(), we initialize the trust_level field to "-1", with
the idea that if gpg does not return a trust level at all (if there is
no signature, or if the signature is made by an unknown key), we'll
use that value. But this has two problems:

  1. Since the field is an enum, it's up to the compiler to decide what
     underlying storage to use, and it only has to fit the values we've
     declared. So we may not be able to store "-1" at all. And indeed,
     on my system (linux with gcc), the resulting enum is an unsigned
     32-bit value, and -1 becomes 4294967295.

     The difference may seem academic (and you even get "-1" if you pass
     it to printf("%d")), but it means that code like this:

       status |= sigc->trust_level < configured_min_trust_level;

     does not necessarily behave as expected. This turns out not to be a
     bug in practice, though, because we keep the "-1" only when gpg did
     not report a signature from a known key, in which case the line
     above:

       status |= sigc->result != 'G';

     would always set status to non-zero anyway. So only a 'G' signature
     with no parsed trust level would cause a problem, which doesn't
     seem likely to trigger (outside of unexpected gpg behavior).

  2. When using the "%GT" format placeholder, we pass the value to
     gpg_trust_level_to_str(), which complains that the value is out of
     range with a BUG(). This behavior was introduced by 803978da49
     (gpg-interface: add function for converting trust level to string,
     2022-07-11). Before that, we just did a switch() on the enum, and
     anything that wasn't matched would end up as the empty string.

     Curiously, solving this by naively doing:

       if (level < 0)
               return "";

     in that function isn't sufficient. Because of (1) above, the
     compiler can (and does in my case) actually remove that conditional
     as dead code!

We can solve both by representing this state as an enum value. We could
do this by adding a new "unknown" value. But this really seems to match
the existing "undefined" level well. GPG describes this as "Not enough
information for calculation".

We have tests in t7510 that trigger this case (verifying a signature
from a key that we don't have, and then checking various %G
placeholders), but they didn't notice the BUG() because we didn't look
at %GT for that case! Let's make sure we check all %G placeholders for
each case in the formatting tests.

The interesting ones here are "show unknown signature with custom
format" and "show lack of signature with custom format", both of which
would BUG() before, and now turn %GT into "undefined". Prior to
803978da49 they would have turned it into the empty string, but I think
saying "undefined" consistently is a reasonable outcome, and probably
makes life easier for anyone parsing the output (and any such parser had
to be ready to see "undefined" already).

The other modified tests produce the same output before and after this
patch, but now we're consistently checking both %G? and %GT in all of
them.

## About The Pull Request
This PR adds a beach ruin based around a ship I've previously made,
called the "Starwalker"

it contains:
some medical supplies ( oinment slurry / herbal pack / crew monitor /
health scanner / charcoal bottle / misc pills )
one Swat suit
one shotgun / one energy cutlass
goliath cloak  / military rig
3 abandoned crates
1 gold crate / one silver crate
lizard wine
one baby carp
a radiant dance machine
a sci protolathe
misc salvage


Lore bit:
After a "most excellent robbery that went like, totally as planned", our
protagonists aboard the Starwalker fled the crime scene, with heavy
damage to the ship's hull. With one of the Engine blocks almost falling
off, The valiant crew decided that the best course of action would be a
"Totally rad emergency landing". This, of course, ended in disaster, as
the pilot was high on LSD.
The pilot did however manage to steer them towards a nearby lak- sike,
it's just some shallow water. Crashing directly onto the ground, the
ship split into multiple fragments, Killing the pilot and crewmate, and
Impaling the captain.
The captain knew that he didn't have long until the bloodloss would get
to him, and started moving all his treasure into a nearby cavern.
_THERE'S NO WAY_ he would die in that godforsaken ship, nor without his
treasures. This is where you now find him, rotting in his "100% real Cow
skin" throne _(spacemart Brand Comfy chair)_ .

Add emotional intelligence evaluation (#589)

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Emotional Intelligence

### Eval description
Evaluates GPT's ability to understand and manage emotional situations
using modified versions of the well-validated, public (i.e.
license-unrestricted) tests first developed by MacCann & Roberts (2008).
Items have actually here been aggregated across three different scales--
the STEU and STEM adult measures, along with a dozen questions from the
youth measure.

Keep in mind that there is not expectation that AI models like GPT-4
should be able to process emotions, so applying any emotional
intelligence test to them should be taken with a grain of salt. These
tests can only measure the AI's ability to understand and analyze
emotional information, not the AI's emotional intelligence in the human
sense.

### What makes this a useful eval?
This eval is useful because it assesses the AI model's ability to
navigate complex or ambiguous emotional situations, which is an
important aspect of human-like communication and problem-solving. By
evaluating the model's performance in this unique domain, we can
identify areas for improvement and better understand its limitations
when it comes to handling emotional contexts. This is particularly
important when considering AI applications that involve interactions
with humans, such as chatbots, personal assistants, and customer support
systems. A better understanding of emotional intelligence can
potentially lead to more natural and effective interactions between AI
models and their users.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This Emotional Intelligence eval provides a unique value because by
testing GPT's capacity to understand and manage emotions, we can gain
insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses in a more
human-centric context. Relatedly, this eval also emphasizes the
importance of empathy and emotional understanding in AI systems that are
designed to interact with humans. By evaluating GPT's performance in
this way, we can contribute to the ongoing development of AI models that
are more attuned to human emotions and can provide better support in
emotionally charged situations, such as mental health counseling, crisis
management, and conflict resolution. Moreover, this Emotional
Intelligence eval can serve as a foundation for further research and
development in the field of AI and emotional understanding, paving the
way for more sophisticated AI models capable of handling complex human
emotions and fostering more effective communication.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval
(data is publicly available on OSF, and does not have usage
restrictions)

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

**_I already have access to the 8k GPT-4 API, but I am kindly requesting
access to the 32k as soon as it becomes available._**

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

Heart Disease Prediction (#538)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Heart Disease Prediction

### Eval description

This eval tests the models ability to correctly predict the probability
of a patient to have heart disease. The dataset is constructed from the
[Heart Failure Prediction
Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)
on Kaggle. The data includes the patient's age, sex, and a number of
medical signals relevant to the diagnosis of heart disease.

The data is provided under the Open Database License (ODbL). 

```
fedesoriano. (September 2021). Heart Failure Prediction Dataset. Retrieved [Mar 31, 2023] from https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction.
```

### What makes this a useful eval?

This assesses the model's ability to correctly predict adverse medical
events. Correctly predicting heart disease shows the model's capability
for a strong understanding of medicine. The GPT-3.5-turbo models
currently receives an accuracy of 0.778.

(Not required)

As far as I can tell, this is the only eval so far related to making
medical diagnoses. To make sure it was a high quality eval, I tried to
find a dataset with a lot of observations and created by doctors with
the relevant expertise.

This "humble abode" is the home of our 5- now 4 Pirate friends! After a
mildly successful raid on a CMM VIP transport, they managed to take a
Cargo tech (the VIP), and a CMM guard as hostage. sadly it didn't all go
as planned, and the CMM officer managed to free himself and killed one
of the pirates. This is where you now find the cave, with both hostages
executed, their brother buried, and the pirates grieving his unfortunate
passing.

Additions
- Battle Hunger Glyph: Caster and hit entity will have the 'Battle Hunger' effect for 25 seconds. Every 5 seconds they will take physical damage (scales with health and mana, can't exceed 20% health) and be slowed for 1.5 seconds. Removed by killing a mob or player. Default is 1 kill. 2 amps = +1 kill, 2 dampens = -1 kill for caster. Max is 3 kills, min is 1 kill

- Life Leech Glyph: Life Leech for 15 seconds. Every 3 seconds they will take damage proportionate to how much health is missing from every nearby entity. The damage taken will then be converted to health and equally distributed. WIll follow the same range formula. Caster will be healed regardless if nearby or not. range is 3 + 1 range per aoe. max is book tier * 2

- Deaths Bane Trinket: Upon taking lethal damage, gain Deaths Bane 1 effect for 6 seconds. Getting a kill will cause Deaths Bane to go on cooldown for 2 minutes. If you don't kill anything in time, you will die.

- Explosive Blood Charm: 25% chance on damage to cause all nearby entities to be knocked back and take half of the damage dealt. Knockback and range scales with mana. 10 sec cooldown.

Changes
- Blood Slime Glyph: Now scales based on hit entities health. (base is 6)
- Combo Glyph: Costs 0 mana, but in order to use it you need more than or equal to the mana lost on entity hit.
- Increased/Decreased mana costs on glyphs for consistency

Fixes
- Silenced all the debug line
- Turrets should work now, fake players can now cast spells

Merge pull request #15492 from barrettj12/openstack-meta

https://github.com/juju/juju/pull/15492

The interactive add-cloud is painful because it will often reject the endpoint URL without giving any reason why. See https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju/+bug/1908630

In the Openstack provider's `Ping` method, at least pass on the error information to the user, to make it a little less painful.
```

```

Do the same with the MAAS and LXD providers.

Also, fix a silly check in the LXD provider's `Ping` method that was rejecting perfectly good URLs. We're already using `lxd.EnsureHostPort(endpoint)` to fill in the scheme/port if not provided, but we were checking the returned value equals the input (and returning an unhelpful error if not). Remove this check.

[MIRROR] Makes Black Market Uplinks more easily craftable, adds them to uncommon maint loot pool [MDB IGNORE] (#20602)

* Makes Black Market Uplinks more easily craftable, adds them to uncommon maint loot pool (#74744)

## About The Pull Request

Replaced the subspace amplifier in the Black Market Uplink's crafting
recipe with a signaller and a microlaser.

Added the Black Market Uplink to the maintenance loot pool.
## Why It's Good For The Game

The BMU is an _extremely_ rare device to find in rounds. It can quite
literally ONLY be found via the crafting recipe, and with how stupidly
bloated the crafting lists are, it isn't something many people know
about. All this means that a very unique and engaging gimmick item is
tragically extremely obscured.

To add to this, the recipe requires a _subspace amplifier_. These items
are UNBELIEVABLY rare - they need you to vend them from a techfab with
bluespace communication technology researched, which is fair to say is
not a common thing. Sometimes maps have them in tech storage, but even
then you have to break and enter which can be quite risky at times and
an annoying blockade the other times.

The black market items are not worth this much hassle. They are all
small cute gimmicky objects that do not heavily impact the round. By
making it not only easier to craft with common items, but also appear in
the maintenance loot pool, this will make assistants find out about it
more often, which can further incentivize them to utilize the **cargo
bounty system** to get enough money to buy their funny gadgets.

Another idea would be to make the uplink appear as a bounty item, which
would be a great way to tell players it exists and encourage them to mix
both systems together. The system for getting items is also
unnecessarily, miserably awful - your item either gets literally thrown
into space from a random direction, or it is teleported silently without
warning in 60 seconds onto a completely random place which can very much
include Security, Command, the Vault, or other high-security areas.
Needing to B&E into these areas to get your durathread vest is, uh. Not
worth it. However these aren't part of this PR, unless they're given the
A-OK. (also maybe make it cargo purchasable?)

lib/sort: make swap functions more generic

Patch series "lib/sort & lib/list_sort: faster and smaller", v2.

Because CONFIG_RETPOLINE has made indirect calls much more expensive, I
thought I'd try to reduce the number made by the library sort functions.

The first three patches apply to lib/sort.c.

Patch #1 is a simple optimization.  The built-in swap has special cases
for aligned 4- and 8-byte objects.  But those are almost never used;
most calls to sort() work on larger structures, which fall back to the
byte-at-a-time loop.  This generalizes them to aligned *multiples* of 4
and 8 bytes.  (If nothing else, it saves an awful lot of energy by not
thrashing the store buffers as much.)

Patch #2 grabs a juicy piece of low-hanging fruit.  I agree that nice
simple solid heapsort is preferable to more complex algorithms (sorry,
Andrey), but it's possible to implement heapsort with far fewer
comparisons (50% asymptotically, 25-40% reduction for realistic sizes)
than the way it's been done up to now.  And with some care, the code
ends up smaller, as well.  This is the "big win" patch.

Patch #3 adds the same sort of indirect call bypass that has been added
to the net code of late.  The great majority of the callers use the
builtin swap functions, so replace the indirect call to sort_func with a
(highly preditable) series of if() statements.  Rather surprisingly,
this decreased code size, as the swap functions were inlined and their
prologue & epilogue code eliminated.

lib/list_sort.c is a bit trickier, as merge sort is already close to
optimal, and we don't want to introduce triumphs of theory over
practicality like the Ford-Johnson merge-insertion sort.

Patch #4, without changing the algorithm, chops 32% off the code size
and removes the part[MAX_LIST_LENGTH+1] pointer array (and the
corresponding upper limit on efficiently sortable input size).

Patch #5 improves the algorithm.  The previous code is already optimal
for power-of-two (or slightly smaller) size inputs, but when the input
size is just over a power of 2, there's a very unbalanced final merge.

There are, in the literature, several algorithms which solve this, but
they all depend on the "breadth-first" merge order which was replaced by
commit 835cc0c8477f with a more cache-friendly "depth-first" order.
Some hard thinking came up with a depth-first algorithm which defers
merges as little as possible while avoiding bad merges.  This saves
0.2*n compares, averaged over all sizes.

The code size increase is minimal (64 bytes on x86-64, reducing the net
savings to 26%), but the comments expanded significantly to document the
clever algorithm.

TESTING NOTES: I have some ugly user-space benchmarking code which I
used for testing before moving this code into the kernel.  Shout if you
want a copy.

I'm running this code right now, with CONFIG_TEST_SORT and
CONFIG_TEST_LIST_SORT, but I confess I haven't rebooted since the last
round of minor edits to quell checkpatch.  I figure there will be at
least one round of comments and final testing.

This patch (of 5):

Rather than having special-case swap functions for 4- and 8-byte
objects, special-case aligned multiples of 4 or 8 bytes.  This speeds up
most users of sort() by avoiding fallback to the byte copy loop.

Despite what ca96ab859ab4 ("lib/sort: Add 64 bit swap function") claims,
very few users of sort() sort pointers (or pointer-sized objects); most
sort structures containing at least two words.  (E.g.
drivers/acpi/fan.c:acpi_fan_get_fps() sorts an array of 40-byte struct
acpi_fan_fps.)

The functions also got renamed to reflect the fact that they support
multiple words.  In the great tradition of bikeshedding, the names were
by far the most contentious issue during review of this patch series.

x86-64 code size 872 -> 886 bytes (+14)

Uytterhoeven.

[evals] Word from first letters of words in a sentence (#346)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
first-letters

### Eval description

Given a sentence, extract the word obtained from concatenating the first
letters of its words.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This task represents a failure mode for both GPT3.5 and GPT4, while
being extremely easy for humans.

Both models tend to do OK with shorter sentences, but fail with a larger
number of words.

For humans however, this task is trivial, regardless of the length of
the sentence.

GPT3.5 exhibits another failure mode in which it often fails to follow
the precise instruction of using only letters in its response.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

The task is highly trivial for humans, yet both GPT4 and GPT3.5 struggle
with it.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Rhyming words in a different language (Hebrew) (#176)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name

hebrew-rhyme

### Eval description

Given a pair of two words in English, the task is to determine whether
their Hebrew translations rhyme and if so, output the rhyming pair in
Hebrew.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This task tests the ability of the model to carry out a composite task
that involves reasoning in a different language than the source
language. It is relatively simple for a bilingual human but
gpt-3.5-turbo scores about the same as random guessing.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [ ] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.jsonl`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the

applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,

[evals] ROT13 string evals (#361)

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
ROT13

### Eval description

This is a test for GPT4s character-level abilities. It's aware of ROT13
and makes a pretty solid attempt at decoding these ROT13 strings, but it
messes up a lot. The accuracy for GPT 3.5 Turbo is 0.05.

### What makes this a useful eval?

A human with a character lookup table could easily solve these ROT13
decoding. Also, based on my testing with GPT 3.5 Turbo, the model is
happy to make an attempt, even though the results it gives are
incorrect.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,

[eval] Forth Stack Simulator (#351)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow

with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Forth Stack Simulator

### Eval description

Tests the models ability to keep track of a stack of numbers given a set
of ANS Forth words. The model is asked to respond to a series of numbers
and words with the resulting stack representation. The words used in the
tests are arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and stack operators:
`drop`, `swap`, `rot`, `over`, `dup`, `2over`, `2drop`, `2swap`, `2dup`,
`nip`. The prompts and expected results on the stack are all less than
15 numbers and words long.

### What makes this a useful eval?

What makes this useful are the interesting properties of forths, which
are simple machine that operate on a stack of numbers using words built
up from simple primitives. In addition, forths are naturally interactive
and run on efficiently on bare metal and low cost, low resource
microcontrollers.

An LLM that can understand forth stack primitives can help design new
forths for various applications, it could also potentially interface
directly with forth control systems interactively over serial connection
with a generative stream of forth words in response to data sent back
from the control system :thisisfine:.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [ ] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

Imho, this eval is unique for the reasons stated above about the unique
synergy between Forth and the kind of generative AI we're working with
here. Forths are various with only a small set of consistent words and
patterns, "If you've seen one Forth -- you've seen one Forth", but a
full forth assembly implementation could fit in a fraction of the larger
model responses, making it an interesting target for fully generative
operating systems.

Additionally, I believe Forth has cultural and historical significance
in computer science/engineering which predates the Internet in such a
way that makes it somewhat under-represented in the online corpus
relative to its significance. A model of all human knowledge should have
a strong grasp on how it works.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Taxes Eval

### Eval description

Tests the model's ability to evaluate tax liability for generic examples
from common cities including NYC, SF, and Seattle. The eval also tests
ordering of multiple choice options, with the model outputting different
results if the multiple choice labels are switched around.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Taxes are a relatively logically straightforward task, yet there is a
high degree of complexity to the legal and tax system, which makes
calculations difficult to estimate.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite

things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

BACKPORT: tcp: instrument tcp sender limits chronographs

This patch implements the skeleton of the TCP chronograph
instrumentation on sender side limits:

	1) idle (unspec)
	2) busy sending data other than 3-4 below
	3) rwnd-limited
	4) sndbuf-limited

The limits are enumerated 'tcp_chrono'. Since a connection in
theory can idle forever, we do not track the actual length of this
uninteresting idle period. For the rest we track how long the sender
spends in each limit. At any point during the life time of a
connection, the sender must be in one of the four states.

If there are multiple conditions worthy of tracking in a chronograph
then the highest priority enum takes precedence over
the other conditions. So that if something "more interesting"
starts happening, stop the previous chrono and start a new one.

The time unit is jiffy(u32) in order to save space in tcp_sock.
This implies application must sample the stats no longer than every
49 days of 1ms jiffy.

Give slimes their sex back (not the ERP one) (#14380)

<!-- Please read these guidelines before opening your PR: https://docs.spacestation14.io/en/getting-started/pr-guideline -->
<!-- The text between the arrows are comments - they will not be visible on your PR. -->

## About the PR
<!-- What does it change? What other things could this impact? -->

Gives back the ability for slimes to have a definitive sex. Cosmetic/visual things such as emotes/other stuff use the person's sex and not the gender and I feel like that the removal of slime's having sexes was just to show that the species refactor could handle unsexed species.

**Media**
<!-- 
PRs which make ingame changes (adding clothing, items, new features, etc) are required to have media attached that showcase the changes.
Small fixes/refactors are exempt.
Any media may be used in SS14 progress reports, with clear credit given.

New Agda syntax highlighting extension for VSCode (#562)

I've written an improved Agda syntax-highlighting extension for VSCode
called _agda-syntax_
([GitHub](https://github.com/fredrik-bakke/agda-syntax-vscode), [VSCode
Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FredrikBakke.agda-syntax)).
Although it is still in preview, my opinion is that it is already a
significant improvement over the previously used extension. Therefore, I
propose that we migrate our development environment (for VSCode users)
to use this new extension.

### Some highlights of the extension
Compared to the previously used extension, this new extension
- injects into markdown syntax, so that the markdown code can be
highlighted as markdown code as well
- highlights all variable declarations (with some bugs still), module
names, wildcard symbols, all reserved keywords (and only recognizes
reserved keywords as reserved keywords)
- Recognizes the appropriate token-boundaries
- Highlights line comments properly

Please understand that the grammar framework that has to be used to
write the extension is highly limited, so not all highlighting
functionality can be implemented. For instance, the parsing must be done
in a single pass, and the functionality to match over multiple lines is
very limited. Hence, for example, matching the left-hand side of an
equals sign is very gnarly (although I have one idea left to try with
regard to this).

Still, I would greatly appreciate any feedback, either if it is a bug or
a feature request, which is another reason why I want to introduce it
into our defined development environment at this point.

If you want to try out the extension right now, follow the VSCode
Marketplace link:

Manually hide our DesktopWindowXamlSource (#15165)

As discussed in #6507

Newer builds of Windows do this automatically. However, this was spotted
in the wild on 1.18. It's possible the threading changes created a
situation where the OS-side fix no longer applied to us. So let's just
do it manually. It doesn't have any side effects.

I saw this once on Win11, but couldn't repro it this morning when I
tried to add this fix. I'm just gonna assume this worked, despite the
fact that I can't repro it on win11 anymore.

closes #6507

See also #14957

## detailed description

> `WindowsXamlManager::XamlCore::Initialize` calls
`ConfigureCoreWindow`, which creates a `CoreWindow` on the thread

> Problem is, we're calling that on the main thread (which doesn't have
_any_ windows), and then eventually creating a `DesktopWindowXamlSource`
on a second thread for the actual window

> It's not that it "manages a window", it's that it "manages xaml on
Windows OS". just use ICoreWindowInterop -- QI for ICoreWindowInterop
and call get_WindowHandle.

Spanish translation overhaul + Addition of es-ES alternative

In its current state, the Spanish translations for Duckstation are a mess of different dialects, multiple translations for the same terms, mistranslations or excessively literal translations, and typos.

It's a shame, because you could feel that the initial translations were done with care, but were muddled with future revisions.

This commit tries to solve all of these and also change the initial decision of the first translator to have an "universal" "neutral" Spanish, as time has proven it's not possible without a dedicated translator who actually wants to have one Spanish language for all Spanish-speakers across the globe.

I'm not going to be that one, so the next option would be to duplicate the Spanish translations into two: one for the Spanish-speaking American people (called "Latin American Spanish", "español de Hispanoamérica", code es-419") and one for the European Spanish speakers (called "Spanish (Spain)", "español de España", code es-ES).

This distinction is used in multiple software applications that managed to have translators for different languages, and should also funnel any future Latin American Spanish and European Spanish translators to the corresponding file.

I have tried to follow as many existing terms and constructions as possible, restoring and/or rewording any phrasal constructions that were disunified by the multiple translators.

Since I have a limited experience with Latin American Spanish, this commit should be sent as a draft for additional revisions. I'm open to stick to having a single Spanish language, but it has to be done RIGHT.

This is an overview of changes across the board:
 - Added missing translations for QT and Android builds.
 - Unified translations between those.
 - Updated the QT file with the latest string values.
 - Massive removal of Title Uppercasing inherited from English in menu strings (the rules set by the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language, or RAE, limit the areas where Title Uppercasing is considered correct in Spanish. Menu names and window header texts are not within those areas).
 - Unified the treatment of users in the Latin American version to formal "ustedeo". This treatment could be modified with additional input.
 - Removed any gendering assumptions from any string directed towards the user (Are you sure...?, changed ¿Está/s seguro...? with ¿Seguro que...?)
 - Naturalization rewrites.
 - Typo corrections.
 - Gender corrections over definitive terms.
 - Adding missing NBSPs after required mathemathical characters or units.
 - Mass replacement of double/single quotes with angled quotes (the ones approved for Spanish).
 - Quoted non-Spanish, non-proper noun English words as dictated by RAE.
 - Removal of unwanted hyphens to join words (Auto-detectar with Detección automática, post-procesamiento with posprocesamiento). In Spanish, hyphens tend to separate, rather than join.
 - Revision of the compound forms, unified depending on Latin American Spanish or European Spanish.
 - Lowercased the first word of a text between parenthesis (Spanish rules dictate that they should be considered a continuation of the phrase, and thus, they should start with lowercase unless it's a proper noun or a word that must be uppercased) and corrected the positions between periods and parentheses.
 - Unified the accentuation rules for the adverb solo/sólo and the demostrative pronouns (este/ese/aquel) by removing all accents in European Spanish (following the RAE's 2010 suggestions) or keeping/adding them for Latin American Spanish (the 2010 rule ended up being a suggestion because while Spain has mostly deprecated those accents, it appears that the Latin American countries have not). To discuss?
 - Tweaked the key shortcuts for the QT menu to minimize duplicates.
 - Terms unified (this list doesn't represent the entirety of the changes):
    - Failed to (Fallo al/Error al): Fallo al
    - Hardcore Mode (Modo Hardcore/Modo Difícil): «hardcore» mode (Foreign non-proper nouns should be quoted, RetroAchievements does not have an official Spanish translation, so the term should be kept in English)
    - Enable/Disable (habilitado/deshabilitado/activado/desactivado/activo/inactivo): habilitado/deshabilitado
    - host (host/anfitrión/sistema): sistema, TO BE DETERMINED AND UNIFIED
    - Signed (numbers; firmados): (números) con signo
    - scan (verb and noun; escanear): buscar/búsqueda
    - Clear (something, like bindings or codes; despejar, limpiar): borrar/quitar
    - requirement (of a system, requisito/requerimento): requisito
    - input (of a controller, control): entrada
    - Threaded X (hilo de X): X multihilo
    - Frame Pacing (frame pacing): duración de fotogramas
    - XX-bit (XX-bit): XX bits (proper form)
    - Widescreen (screens, widescreen hacks; pantalla ancha, pantalla panorámica): pantalla panorámica
    - Antialiasing (anti-aliasing): Antialiasing (considered a proper noun by NVidia, doesn't need that hyphen)
    - hash: «hash» (could be discussed as "sumas de verificación", like on Dolphin)

Fix re-processing REPLACED charge versions (#192)

https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/WATER-3950

This change was the result of looking into an edge case found during testing. We'll try to explain with an example. But to summarise.

The new process for handling **REPLACED** charge versions we just added, was processing a charge version that had already been processed. This led to a credit being added to the billing batch that shouldn't be.

Our fix, though small in how it affects `ProcessBillingBatchService`, is to scrap the `ProcessReplacedChargeVersionsService` and deal with **REPLACED** charge versions outside of the main process. Instead, our primary `FetchChargeVersionsService` will now return both **REPLACED** and **APPROVED** records.

## Before the fix

So, imagine we have licence `01/123/456` and linked to it are 2 charge versions both for the same account.

> For the purposes of this the abstraction period is all year and the charge reference is the same for each charge version. Also, the charge version ID below ascends in the order they are added. But we list them in the tables in the order the UI will display them.

### Bill run 1

|ID   |Invoice account|Start|End  |Status  |
|-----|---------------|-----|-----|--------|
|CHG02|ACC88          |01/09| -   |APPROVED|
|CHG01|ACC88          |01/04|31/08|APPROVED|

The annual bill run was generated resulting in

|ID   |Charge Version|Invoice account|Billable days|Debit or Credit?|
|-----|--------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
|TRN01|CHG01         |ACC88          |153          |Debit           |
|TRN02|CHG02         |ACC88          |212          |Debit           |

### Bill run 2

Then, a new charge version linked to a different billing account is added which replaces `CHG01`.

|ID   |Invoice account|Start|End  |Status  |
|-----|---------------|-----|-----|--------|
|CHG02|ACC88          |01/09| -   |APPROVED|
|CHG03|ACC99          |01/04|31/08|APPROVED|
|CHG01|ACC88          |01/04|31/08|REPLACED|

The supplementary bill run is generated resulting in

|ID   |Charge Version|Invoice account|Billable days|Debit or Credit?|
|-----|--------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
|TRN03|CHG01         |ACC88          |153          |Credit          |
|TRN04|CHG03         |ACC99          |153          |Debit           |

The first thing to note is `CHG02` doesn't make an appearance. It's worth understanding why because this is part of the reason this edge case eventually fails. Prior to this change we only fetched **APPROVED** charge versions and calculated their billable days. We then compared this with previous billing transactions.

So, when processing `CHG02` we find `TRN01` and `TRN02`. This is because we're looking for previous transactions for `ACC88`, the invoice account linked to `CHG02`. We then compare them to our calculated transaction. `TRN02` matches (same licence, invoice account and billable days), so we cancel both out of the bill run. `TRN01` doesn't match (212 to 153 billable days) so is reversed (debit to credit) and included in the bill run.

Because `TRN01` is being included we need to create a billing invoice record for `ACC88` as part of this bill run.

`CHG03` goes through the same process. Only we find no previous transactions for `ACC99`. So nothing gets cancelled out and the calculated transaction is included in the bill run.

### Bill run 3

Another new charge version is added linked to `ACC99` which replaces `CHG03`. A possible reason for this is a mistake with the details entered for `CHG03`.

|ID   |Invoice account|Start|End  |Status  |
|-----|---------------|-----|-----|--------|
|CHG02|ACC88          |01/09| -   |APPROVED|
|CHG04|ACC99          |01/04|31/08|APPROVED|
|CHG03|ACC99          |01/04|31/08|REPLACED|
|CHG01|ACC88          |01/04|31/08|REPLACED|

The supplementary bill run is generated. It should result in an empty bill run. Instead, it was resulting in this

|ID   |Charge Version|Invoice account|Billable days|Debit or Credit?|
|-----|--------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
|TRN05|CHG02         |ACC88          |212          |Credit          |

It should be empty because the change hasn't impacted what we have previously billed. `ACC88` got their credit for April to August in Bill run 2. `ACC99` was correctly charged for the same period in the same bill run. `CHG04` has not changed the abstraction period or the billing account and as it replaces `CHG03` it is for exactly the same period.

But we have ended up with a credit. This is because the new stage in the process we added to handle **REPLACED** charge versions that have invoice accounts that have _not been processed_ has gone wrong.

Remember why `CHG02` didn't make an appearance in bill run 2? For the same reason, it doesn't appear in bill run 3. What has changed is the previous transactions returned as part of that process. Now, it finds `TRN01`, `TRN02`, and `TRN03`. Before we even compare our calculated lines against these results we first cleanse them of matching debits and credits. This is because if we have a debit matched by a credit for the invoice account, we can safely assume that is something which has already been dealt with as part of a previous change to the charge versions.

That is true for this case. `TRN01` which is a debit from bill run 1, was credited by `TRN03` as part of bill run 2. So, all that is left to compare `CHG02` against is `TRN02`. They cancel each other out which means at this point in the process there is _nothing to bill_ for `ACC88`. Because of this we _do not_ create a billing invoice record for `ACC88`.

`CHG04` then gets processed. We find `TRN04` as part of that, compare it to our calculated transaction, and get a match so both get cancelled out.

At this point, we have nothing in the bill run which is correct. But then we kick off our new replaced charge versions process. That grabs any **REPLACED** charge versions flagged for supplementary billing that as yet have not been processed. We determine this by cross-checking their invoice account with those in billing invoices.

And there is the flaw! We have processed `ACC88` as part of looking at `CHG02`. But we didn't create a billing invoice. So, `CHG01` gets returned and processed. The `ProcessReplacedChargeVersionsService` doesn't do any calculations. But it does go looking for previous transactions for the invoice account. It will return `TRN01`, `TRN02`, and `TRN03`. As before `TRN01` and `TRN03` will cancel each other out. But now `TRN02` has nothing to cancel it out, which means we add it to the bill run.

😱🤦😩

## Explaining the fix

Once we realised what was going on our initial plan was to add another query to `ProcessReplacedChargeVersionsService` to filter out **REPLACED** charge versions with invoice accounts also linked to **APPROVED** charge versions. But with `FetchChargeVersions`, `FetchReplacedChargeVersions` and this new one we'd be running almost identical queries 3 times.

What if we could process **REPLACED** charge versions at the same time as **APPROVED** ones? In [Reverse previous SROC billing batches in supplementary bill run process](https://github.com/DEFRA/water-abstraction-system/pull/186) we realised only pulling out previous debit transactions was causing things to go wrong. Using the same premise, if we pulled _all_ charge versions through would the whole compare and cancel idea work better? It would certainly reduce the complexity and improve performance.

Our testing confirmed this.

### Bill run 3 (fixed)

Remember the situation prior to running bill run 3.

|ID   |Invoice account|Start|End  |Status  |
|-----|---------------|-----|-----|--------|
|CHG02|ACC88          |01/09| -   |APPROVED|
|CHG04|ACC99          |01/04|31/08|APPROVED|
|CHG03|ACC99          |01/04|31/08|REPLACED|
|CHG01|ACC88          |01/04|31/08|REPLACED|

Our expectation is an empty bill run.

> If you run this example through manually you actually get a 1p credit. This is just the result of a rounding in the overall calculation and expected!

`ProcessBillingBatchService` will look at `CHG01`. We've added some logic that says 'this is replaced - do not bother calculating' which means it will iterate to `CHG02`. That will generate a calculated line. `CHG03` comes next but before we process it we trigger a call to finalise the current billing invoice for `ACC88`. That's where we look at previous transactions and return `TRN01`, `TRN02`, and `TRN03`. As we covered earlier, `TRN01` and `TRN03` cancel each other out and our calculated line when matched to `TRN02` also gets cancelled.

This leaves us with nothing to bill which is what we want. And as we've removed the `ProcessReplacedChargeVersionsService` step, we're no longer making the mistake of adding something that's been processed.

### Nothing broken

We are also still handling the scenario `ProcessReplacedChargeVersionsService` was built to handle. Imagine we had a single all-year charge version linked to `ACC66` debited in the annual bill run. We then replace it with a charge version linked to a new invoice account.

|ID   |Invoice account|Start|End  |Status  |
|-----|---------------|-----|-----|--------|
|CHG06|ACC77          |01/09| -   |APPROVED|
|CHG05|ACC66          |01/04| -   |REPLACED|

When the supplementary billing is run previously `CHG05` would have been handled by the `ProcessReplacedChargeVersionsService`. Now, it's included in our main process. When we finalise the billing invoice for `ACC66` we'll see that debit, reverse it and include it in the bill run. With nothing calculated and no other transactions, it won't get cancelled out.

[ci] Mirror third-party images and hailgenetics images on deploy (#12818)

- On *deploys*, makes sure that whatever is in our third-party images is
in our private registry before starting builds like hail-ubuntu that
might depend on those images. This means that we can update our ubuntu
base image without the australians needing to deploy any images by hand.
However, this does not run in PRs because I 1) didn't want to add that
kind of latency for PRs and 2) we don't do any kind of namespacing for
our images so if we did include this for a PR that ultimately wasn't
merged we would have to manually remove the image anyway so why not
manually add it if you're going to PR it… I think point 2 is a little
weak but I recall this being what we agreed on a couple months back when
we discussed this. I'm wondering if we should just eat the minute or so
latency at the beginning of PRs to be safe but it also feels like a
shame for something that changes so infrequently.

- Again on deploys, upload the hailgenetics/* images to the private
registry if they don't already exist there. This way any deployments
that aren't hail team's GCP deployment can get these images
automatically when they deploy a new SHA instead of uploading them
manually. It won't backfill skipped versions, but we decided that was
ok. This seems less relevant for testing on PRs as it will get triggered
on releases and we can easily dev deploy to rectify the image if this
breaks.

TrapsNeverHappen mode (#4059)

The goal of this mode is to remove obviously-unneeded code like

(drop
  (i32.load
    (local.get $x)))

In general we can't remove it, as the load might trap - we'd be removing
a side effect. This is fairly rare in general, but actually becomes quite
annoying with wasm GC code where such patterns are more common,
and we really need to remove them.

Historically the IgnoreImplicitTraps option was meant to help here. However,
in practice it did not quite work well enough for most production code, as
mentioned e.g. in #3934 . TrapsNeverHappen mode is an attempt to fix that,
based on feedback from @askeksa in that issue, and also I believe this
implements an idea that @fitzgen mentioned a while ago (sorry, I can't
remember where exactly...). So I'm hopeful this will be generally useful
and not just for GC.

The idea in TrapsNeverHappen mode is that traps are assumed to not
actually happen at runtime. That is, if there is a trap in the code, it will
not be reached, or if it is reached then it will not trap. For example, an
(unreachable) would be assumed to never be reached, which means
that the optimizer can remove it and any code that executes right before
it:

(if
  (..condition..)
  (block
    (..code that can be removed, if it does not branch out..)
    (..code that can be removed, if it does not branch out..)
    (..code that can be removed, if it does not branch out..)
    (unreachable)))

And something like a load from memory is assumed to not trap, etc.,
which in particular would let us remove that dropped load from earlier.

This mode should be usable in production builds with assertions
disabled, if traps are seen as failing assertions. That might not be true
of all release builds (maybe some use traps for other purposes), but
hopefully in some. That is, if traps are like assertions, then enabling
this new mode would be like disabling assertions in release builds
and living with the fact that if an assertion would have been hit then
that is "undefined behavior" and the optimizer might have removed
the trap or done something weird.

TrapsNeverHappen (TNH) is different from IgnoreImplicitTraps (IIT).
The old IIT mode would just ignore traps when computing effects.
That is a simple model, but a problem happens with a trap behind
a condition, like this:

if (x != 0) foo(1 / x);

We won't trap on integer division by zero here only because of the
guarding if. In IIT, we'd compute no side effects on 1 / x, and then
we might end up moving it around, depending on other code in
the area, and potentially out of the if - which would make it happen
unconditionally, which would break.

TNH avoids that problem because it does not simply ignore traps.
Instead, there is a new hasUnremovableSideEffects() method
that must be opted-in by passes. That checks if there are no side
effects, or if there are, if we can remove them - and we know we can
remove a trap if we are running under TrapsNeverHappen mode,
as the trap won't happen by assumption. A pass must only use that
method where it is safe, that is, where it would either remove the
side effect (in which case, no problem), or if not, that it at least does
not move it around (avoiding the above problem with IIT).

This PR does not implement all optimizations possible with
TNH, just a small initial set of things to get started. It is already
useful on wasm GC code, including being as good as IIT on removing
unnecessary casts in some cases, see the test suite updates here.
Also, a significant part of the 18% speedup measured in

#4052 (comment)

is due to my testing with this enabled, as otherwise the devirtualization
there leaves a lot of unneeded code.

all my beautiful webgl shidd (lots of stuff)

since my last last update i have been COOKING ALSO SIDE NOTE IM WRITING THIS through local mainpage but anyways i have been researching and it started with webgl test then web hypo amd i had the idea to write to
 one framebuffer to copy the state then copy it into another framebuffer for use as the previous generation but you kinda couldnt do that so i indw i was missing something so i CAVED in and googled how to game of life in webgl and found some random website that used copyTexImage2D and i just pasted it in there and it somehow worked!
Once i did that i had the idea to make a texture and use it as the activation function so i multiplied what that texture had on it to the sum (cnnevo.html) then i thought i could edit that texture and make it disappear like it waas burning away (burn/2.html) but i haven't really figured that one out (also i wanted it to burn like the fnaf newspaper at the start of the game but i couldn't figure out how to have the life and newspaper on screen (ok while writing this i think i could write all these components to their own framebuffers and render them all in the end))
also soon my website gone be DIFFERENT im talking three js different!!!

Add UPP warcries (#2878)

# About the pull request

Replaces the normal warcry for the UPP faction to use russian voices
instead.

The warcries are mostly stuff like `za rodinu` and `uraa`, so yeah,
pretty much just typical soviet warcries.

I haven't focused on adding dozens of voicelines due to the fact that
this is a minor faction whose appearance is only in events and/or ERT's.
However, I can try to get some more, if requested.

# Explain why it's good for the game

Lately, I have noticed an increase of HvH events (in which, I have
participated). I found that it is quite uninmersive how every UPP
soldier is literally yelling in english at the same time as marines are
also yelling the same voicelines. So yeah. I kind of found it just weird
and since then I've been thinking of adding something like this to the
server.

# Testing Photographs and Procedure
Tested it myself, works. I can upload a video if it is really needed,
however.

Readds the autodoc, in a nerfed state (#2910)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->

# About the pull request

Readds the autodoc back to the Almayer with its capabilities neutered;
it can now only do emergency treatments and cannot do advanced surgeries
like organ repair or limb replacement.

The autodoc is now only capable of the following surgeries:

- Brute and burn damage treatment
- Toxin damage treatment
- Shrapnel removal
- Closing open incisions
- Blood transfusions
- Dialysis

The following procedures have been **removed** from the autodoc and can
no longer be used:

- Internal bleeding surgery
- Corrective eye surgery
- Organ damage treatment
- Facial reconstruction
- Limb replacement
- Bone repair surgery

While we're at it, also fixed the broken icon states for the sleeper,
autodoc, and body scanner in the mapping view.

# Explain why it's good for the game

If memory serves me right, the autodoc was initially removed because it
basically acted as a doctor in and of itself, and docs would rather
shove someone inside it to do their work rather than getting their hands
dirty. This helps to change that.

This PR lets the autodoc reprise its role on the Almayer while being
restricted to an "emergency" medical system that can be used to take
some work off doctors' hands by fixing up a patient and doing, as
stated, emergency medical procedures to save their life. It can't do
complex surgeries anymore, so doctors will still need to fix patients up
for that.

package/ci: adapt to arbitrary unnecessary Codecov breakages.

They removed the Python uploader because "nobody used it" (it was in
the top 1% of pip packages), and the token-less upload stopped working
some weeks ago (and of course even an error is reported with a zero
return code, YOLO).

I thought I'd upgrade to the "new" uploader, but can't because it's a
fifty megabyte Node.js binary that doesn't even have an ARM version.
So, yeah, it's now using the long-deprecated bash uploader that is long
unsupported instead. Imagine that!

I hate all this technology. Everything is extremely janky, poorly
documented, and any "upgrade" is actually a massive downgrade that
makes everyone angry. What the fuck.

add alpaca gpt4 dataset (#2610)

The inputs can be quite a lot of different versions of `no input`,
therefore don't use the `input` column for that.
In some cases the text in `input` is already in the instruction, in
these cases, we also don't use the `input` column.

I am not quite sure how to concatenate the `instruction` and the `input`
column. In most cases it seems fine to just replace last appearance of
`.`, `!` or `?` with a colon, e.g.:
Instruction: `Identify the odd one out.`
Input: `Twitter, Instagram, Telegram`
or 
Instruction: `How dense is a given material?`
Input: `Steel`

But we also have some questions like:
Instruction: `Given the following synopsis, what is the moral lesson of
this story?`
Input: `Once upon a time, there was a poor young boy who wanted some
candy. He begged his father for money to buy it, but his father said no
and ordered him to go to bed. As he was going to bed, the boy saw a
five-dollar bill on the counter, which he took and bought the candy.`

Where this might not be the best case. Either way, I think the this one
token will not make significant difference the model and therefore I
just concatenate instruction and input with a space.

Chasm Hell On Icebox - 300 Active Turfs on Prod Moment (#74410)

## About The Pull Request

Spontaneous regressions introduced by #74359
(1e58c1875d9e2f48a306fe31a0626dbbb1990ff9).
```txt
 - Z-Level 2 has 150 active turf(s).
 - Z-Level 3 has 150 active turf(s).
 - Z-Level trait Ice Ruins Underground has 300 active turf(s).
 - Z-Level trait Mining has 300 active turf(s).
 - Z-Level trait Station has 300 active turf(s).
 - End of active turf list.
 ```

Basically the lavaland ruin sucks dogshit and I had to do a lot of stuff to account for everything failing. There was even a moment where we were adding something to `flags_1` instead of `turf_flags` and that was also really bad to figure out.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34697715/229213428-63bb1f6e-6f88-4604-a3c6-e08e20cbfa7a.png)

i also had to add orange genturfs because it was really getting bad with all of the assertions we had to keep making, especially since stuff like this could also show up:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34697715/229213562-4a145453-5f90-4d05-b8cc-5c1beec2b0dd.png)

That's the prison in the red box, those are active turfs because a chasm scraped it away.

Sorry if this is hard to follow but I promise you everything in this is essential. I wish we didn't have to rely on turf flags as much as we do but this is a fix PR, not a refactor.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Even one active turf on IceBox ate up _three_ seconds of SSair's initialization every single time it was really fucking bad.

We haven't had to deal with chasms for about two years so there's a lot of mapping assertions we made since they just weren't a thing, but now they're back so lets do it properly.
## Changelog
:cl:
fix: The prison on IceBox should no longer leak air as often.
/:cl:

I have compiled this map about 30 times until active turfs stopped fucking happening and now I am content. This likely doesn't fix _everything_ because some stuff can still be hidden to me, and we still have PRs that need to be merged to reduce the amount of noise we're getting on prod.

Thrown containers splashing on mobs spill some contents on the floor (#74345)

## About The Pull Request
Spiritual continuation of tgstation/tgstation#74187.

Reagent containers that splash their contents on people also splash the
floor - the amount that gets splashed on the floor is the amount that
missed the target.
### Mapping March

Ckey to receive rewards: N/A (it's not a mapping PR)

## Why It's Good For The Game
Splashing people with a molotov filled with Random Shit now also
splashes that Random Shit all around, making them slightly more spicy to
play around with. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to make fuel
puddles ignite off of lit objects resting on top of them (there's no
item-level proc for hotspot exposure or something). If anyone wants to
advise me on how to make that happen, that'd be cool.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Reagent containers that splash on people when thrown (e.g.
molotovs) now spill their contents on both target and turf. (This means
that throwing molotovs with enough fuel spills fuel puddles, throwing
beakers with acid spills acid on the floor, etc. etc.) Unfortunately,
molotovs still lack the ability to ignite their own spilled fuel, but
we'll get there one day.

QualityScaler 2.0 

 NEW
 - It is now possible to upscale images and videos in one shot
 - The message box is now more "conversational"
 - Now the app will save the upscaled files by adding the chosen resolution % tag. This allows you to try different % resolutions without the produced file overwriting the previous one. 
 --- For example, an image with BSRGANx4 and Resolution 70%:
 --- QualityScaler 1.14 => image_BSRGANx4.png
 --- QualityScaler 2.0   => image_BSRGANx4_70%.png
 - New GUI based on the splendid work of @customtkinter:
 --- it is now possible to select files via a "Select files" button instead of the Drag&Drop function that presented several problems
 --- this new library allows for much more organized and optimized code
 --- the new interface is fully resizable and so adaptable to any screen 
 --- the new interface also allows more space to add new widgets (in the future) to customize the upscale operations 

 BUGFIX & IMPROVEMENTS
 - A comprehensive restructuring of the code and many micro-optimizations:
 --- more than 50% of the code has been restructured to be faster and more readable
 - Updated all dependencies

 FOR DEVS
 - With the new GUI based on @customtkinter, it is easier to run the app via python script and should give less headaches than the old GUI which needed more 3/4 different libraries
 - Many more logs have been added in console (for those who use the app via Python code) 

 I want to sincerely thank the people who support and will support this work (financially and otherwise). 
 Thank you for allowing me to learn how to develop these projects and at the same time be able to help my parents financially. ❤

Reset laststatus for lualine

The bullshittery of workarounds we need just for lualine continues...

Of course lualine has hardcoded setting laststatus to some value with
their fucking useless globalstatus option [0].

Let's reset it after VimEnter again, just because lualine is a special
snowflake.

Top investigators around the world are still trying to find out why
anyone with a sane mind would use lualine's globalstatus option (that
sets laststatus=3 for them) instead of just directly setting
laststatus=3.

Fixes #53

If we encounter a friend class template for which we cannot resolve
the nested-name-specifier (e.g., because it is dependent), do not
error even though we can't represent it in the AST at this point.

This is a horrible, horrible hack. The actual feature we still need to
implement (for C++98!) is covered by PR12292. However, we used to
silently accept this code, so when we recently started rejecting it we
caused some regressions (e.g., <rdar://problem/11147355>). This hack
brings us back to the passable-but-not-good state we had previously.

Fix a horrible infloop in value tracking in the face of dead code.

Amazingly, we just never triggered this without:
1) Moving code around for MetadataTracking so that a certain *different*
   amount of inlining occurs in the per-TU compile step.
2) Then you LTO opt or clang with a bootstrap, and get inlining, loop
   opts, and GVN line up everything *just* right.

I don't really know how we didn't hit this before. We really need to be
fuzz testing stuff, it shouldn't be hard to trigger. I'm working on
crafting a reduced nice test case, and will submit that when I have it,
but I want to get LTO build bots going again.

Revert r318924 Skip over empty sections when checking for contiguous relro

PR35478 https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35478 points out a flaw
in the implementation of r318924 from D40364. The implementation
depends on the Size field being set or the SyntheticSection::empty()
being accurate. These functions are not reliable as some linker script
commands that have yet to be processed may affect the results, causing
some non-zero size sections to be reported as zero size.

I think the first step is to revert r318924 and come up with a better
solution for the underlying problem rather than trying to layer more
heuristics onto the zero sized output section.

Chances are I'll be out of office by the time anyone sees this so feel
free to commit the revert if you agree with me.

Fixes PR35478

Current thoughts on the underlying problem:

Revisiting the motivation for adding the zero size check in the first
place; it was to prevent 0 sized SyntheticSections that a user does
not have full control over from needlessly breaking the PT_GNU_RELRO,
rather than trying to accommodate arbitrarily complex linker
scripts. Looking at the code, it looks like
removeUnusedSyntheticSections() should remove zero sized synthetic
sections. It does, but it doesn't set the Parent to nullptr, this has
the side effect that Sec == InX::BssRelRo->getParent() will make the
parent OutputSection of InX::BssRelRo RelRo even if there is no
InX::BssRelRo.

I tried a quick experiment with setting the Parent to nullptr and this
flushed out a few interesting test failures, it feels like playing
Jenga with every change:

    In the isRelroSection() we have to consider the case where there
    is no .plt and .plt.got but there is a ifunc plt with accompanying
    (ifunc .got or .plt.got)

    The PPC64 has PltHeaderSize == 0. Unfortunately HeaderSize == 0 is
    used to choose between the ifunc plt or normal plt. We seem to get
    away with this at the moment, but tests start to fail when Parent
    is set to nullptr for the .got.plt.

    The InX::BssRelRo and InX::Bss never get their sizes set and they
    are always removed by removeUnusedSyntheticSections(), their
    purpose seems to be as some kind of proxy for add .bss or
    .bss.relro InputSections into their parent OutputSections, they
    therefore don't behave like other SyntheticSections anyway.

My thinking is that some work is needed to make sure that the Sec ==
SyntheticSection->getParent() does a bit more checking before
returning true, particularly for InX::BssRelRo as that has special
behaviour. I'll hope to post something for review as soon as possible.

Refactors and defuckulates dbcore. Adds support for min_threads rustg setting, Reduce query delay, Make unit tests faster (#74852)

dbcore was very fuckulated.

It had 3 lists of queries, but they all had their own current_run style
list to support mc_tick_check (as it was already being done before with
the undeleted query check, so i can understand why they ~~cargo culted~~
mirrored the behavior) This was silly and confusing and unneeded given
two of those loops can only process at most 25 items at a time on
default config, plus these were cheap operations (ask rustg to start
thread, ask rustg to check on thread).

Because of the confusingness of the 6 lists for 3 query states, The code
to run pending/queued queries immediately during world shutdown was
instead looking at the current_run list for active queries, **meaning
those queries got ran twice.**

The queued query system only checked the current active query count in
fire(), meaning even when there was nothing going on in this subsystem
new queries had to wait for the next fire() to run (10 ticks, so 500ms
on default config)

Those have all been fixed.

the config `BSQL_THREAD_LIMIT` has been renamed to
`POOLING_MAX_SQL_CONNECTIONS` and its default was lowered to match
MAX_CONCURRENT_QUERIES .

added a new config `POOLING_MIN_SQL_CONNECTIONS`, allowing you to
pre-allocate a reserve of sql threads.

The queue processing part of SSdbcore's fire() has been made to not obey
mc_tick_check for clarity and to make the following change easier to do:

If there is less than `MAX_CONCURRENT_QUERIES` in the active queue, new
queries activate immediately.

(its ok that there are two configs that kinda do the same thing,
POOLING_MAX_SQL_CONNECTIONS maps to max-threads in the mysql crate, and
it seems to only be a suggestion, meanwhile MAX_CONCURRENT_QUERIES can't
do anything during init, which is when the highest amount of concurrent
queries tend to happen.)

:cl:
config: database configs have been updated for better control over the
connection pool
server: BSQL_THREAD_LIMIT has been renamed to
POOLING_MAX_SQL_CONNECTIONS, old configs will whine but still work.
fix: fixed rare race condition that could lead to a sql query being ran
twice during world shutdown.
/:cl:

I have not tested this pr.

Adds admin alert for revs created through traitor panel (#74862)

## About The Pull Request

So like, using traitor panel to make revs doesn't work. 

Revolutions live and die, currently, by the revolution ruleset datum
dynamic creates. It manages the hostile environment and also processes
to check whether either side should be winning or not.

This means that the revolutionary buttons in the traitor panel are kind
of noob-admin-bait. You press it for a funny revolution and then you
realize it's screwed when all the heads are dead and everyone's
stumbling around cluelessly

This has a proper solution, albeit somewhat difficult - separate out the
revolution from the ruleset, make admin spawned revs create a
revolution. I can do this but it's a lot of effort and this works in the
meanwhile

Pops up a TGUI alert when an admin presses "add revolutionary" in
traitor panel when there is no ongoing revolution. Simply enough, gives
them an alert that it will not work correctly. Lets them decide whether
they want to deal with that. (Because you can manually deal with it via
proc calls, if you've got code smarts.)

## Why It's Good For The Game

Stops admins from stumbling into the same trap without warning.

Can be removed in the future easily when revs are coded better. 

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
admin: Adds a warning that spawning revs via traitor panel will not
function as expected.

Makes a whole bunch of wooden objects flammable (#74827)

## About The Pull Request

This whole PR started because I realized that baseball bats are not
actually flammable which I found weird, then I looked at a whole bunch
of other stuff that really should be flammable but also isn't.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Makes wooden objects behave slightly more consistently? Honestly, most
of these seem like oversights to me.

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: The following structures are now flammable: Picture frame,
fermenting barrel, drying rack, sandals, painting frames, paintings,
spirit board, notice board, dresser, displaycase chassis, wooden
barricade
balance: The following items are now flammable: Baseball bat, rolling
pin, mortar, coffee condiments display, sandals, wooden hatchet, gohei,
popsicle stick, rifle stock

Blink is no longer a forbidden school spell?? (#74487)

## About The Pull Request

Turns blink's school from forbidden to translocation. This has some
incredibly minor changes nobody is going to notice:
- Changes the blink's invocations when mixed with a CERTAIN spell
- If you were very specifically a chaplain with the holy crusade sect
and you casted blink, before it would excommunicate you, now it will
just smite you, as translocation spells are seen as less bad than
forbidden magic
- probably some more niche interactions but that's all I can remember

## Why It's Good For The Game

Guys, I know blink is a very annoying spell but come on now it's not
forbidden magic, that's for heretics and super duper evil stuffs

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: blink is now a translocation spell

Adds better parts for syndie mechs, some tooltips to mech maintenance mode and some little changes. (#74466)

## About The Pull Request
Kinda resusticates #72442 cause the whole conflict was stupid.
Adds t4 parts for dark gygax, mauler and reticence (for the sake of
shitspawn) and t3 for dark honker.
Formulas of better parts to understand the difference:

https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/blob/aff9cf1b434c7a95d156ea20108d8b2bc015083d/code/modules/vehicles/mecha/_mecha.dm#L427-L439


Made examine text into span_notices so it's not just plane text.
Also added tooltips for maintenance. Screens to compare:

Dark gygax will now spawn without access adding regime.
Tool interactions with mech will now have sounds. (wrench and crowbar)
Removing parts from mech will now put them in your hands, and not just
under the mech.
When inserting parts in mech they won't make some noisy noise, already
forgot which noise it was, but i changed it for some reason, so meh.

Also fixed that you can remove capacitors and scanning mods from mech
without proper maintenance as it works with cell. Closes
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/issues/71577
## Why It's Good For The Game
Syndie mechs are still week. Didn't see them in half a year.
## Changelog
:cl:
qol: changed mech description to span_notices and just slightly comfier
to use.
qol: added tooltips for mech's maintenance mode.
balance: added t4 parts for mauler and dark gygax. And t3 parts for dark
honker.
fix: fixed that you can remove capacitor and scanmod from mech without
proper maintenance steps. Now you can't

Tones down the power of nitrous oxide, the reagent. Makes heparin a bit harder to fix to compensate (#74703)

## About The Pull Request

Nitrous Oxide, rather than directly subtracting blood volume per tick,
instead applies the anticoagulant trait ''TRAIT_BLOODY_MESS''. It shares
this with heparin.

However, unlike, heparin, coagulants like Sanguirite will remove the
trait and allow for continued clotting while the reagent is present,
neutering the nitrous oxide's anticoagulant effects (but not the other
parts)

Heparin, on the other hand, will purge Sanguirite while it is in you
system. You must remove the heparin before you can apply an
anticoagulant.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Nitrous Oxide, on top of being a knockout chem that causes you to
suffocate and become drowsy, just starts deleting blood rapidly. About
15 units of it, standard in a syringe, will kill you in about a minute,
but you'll be unconscious for most of it (you'll be at around 50%-60%
blood by the time it is out of your system, so as good as dead). It
doesn't matter that it metabolizes quickly either, since because it
isn't a toxin, it doesn't get purged by livers/improved livers, so you
will probably metabolize all of the chem that enters your system.

Blood is one of those 'hidden damage types', a bit like brain damage.
Once you start losing it _directly,_ you probably don't have a lot of
options to resolve it (unlike a bleed, which you do in various manners),
and the means of causing blood loss has been mostly pretty well
controlled as of late. Heparin directly interacts with wounds as a good
example.

Blood loss is also tied into oxyloss, which is another very mean damage
type in that it causes you to fall into unconsciousness at 50 damage, so
significantly more lethal than normal damage, kept in check by the fact
that breathing restores some of it. Nitrous oxide, you might note,
causes you to stop breathing.

It's cheaper to make than either heparin or lexorin, and since it isn't
a toxin like those chems, it is able to circumvent a few game mechanics
to simply just start killing you. It does the work of chloral hydrate,
lexorin and heparin while it has a remarkably easy recipe.

Following the example of how lexorin was pulled into line, and
consistency with heparin, I've made nitrous oxide an anticoagulant that
may or may not come into play as one. I think this is more up to date
with the state of toxins and chem warefare as a whole, and works with
the relative ease in making nitrous oxide. And it has been this way for
about 5 years, before we got wounds.

(did I mention that nitrous oxide is also an explosive if it gets hot
enough?)

## TL;DR

I think a chem with a pretty basic recipe shouldn't be doing the work of
5 other, more complicated, chemicals while also not being a toxin and
also not interacting with the wounds system or purity system whatsoever.
And being an explosive.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Nitrous oxide, the reagent, increases bleed rate from wounds
rather than directly subtracting blood. It can be counteracted using
coagulants (such as those in epipens).
balance: Heparin purges coagulants. You have to remove heparin from
someone's system before you can use coagulants.
