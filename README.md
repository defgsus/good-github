[MIRROR] Adds a eye-dropper right-click function to the painting canvas. [MDB IGNORE] (#21411)

* Adds a eye-dropper right-click function to the painting canvas. (#75571)

## About The Pull Request
Having used the painting UI to kill some time during long rounds for a
decent chunk of the past year, the need of a quicker and less tedious
way to fix a misclick or mistake like drawing over the wrong pixel has
become clear to me, as well as getting some feedback on the palette
component I made last year.

As the title suggests, this PR adds an eye-dropper function to the
canvas. Right-Click a pixel on the canvas, and the painting tool will
copy its color. Simple as, works on both finished and unfinished
paintings.

As a bonus, you can also right-click one of those selectable
white/colored squares on the color scheme near the bottom of the UI (if
using spraycan/palette) to change its color without having to go back to
main game window and a radial menu.

EDIT: With the tooltip added to the UI, I can say it's ready.

## Why It's Good For The Game
This PR aims to add better options to change colors on the go and
improve the user experience on the painting UI.

## Changelog

:cl:
qol: Adds a eye-dropper-like right-click function to the painting canvas
UI. Right-Click a pixel on the canvas while holding a painting tool to
have it copy its color.
qol: Also adds a right-click function to the color palette at the bottom
of the UI to allow users to set its colors without having to alternate
between the game window and the UI.
qol: Lastly, a tooltip has been added near the top-left corner of the
same UI to let players know of these features.

* Adds a eye-dropper right-click function to the painting canvas.

[evals] Word from first letters of words in a sentence (#346)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
first-letters

### Eval description

Given a sentence, extract the word obtained from concatenating the first
letters of its words.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This task represents a failure mode for both GPT3.5 and GPT4, while
being extremely easy for humans.

Both models tend to do OK with shorter sentences, but fail with a larger
number of words.

For humans however, this task is trivial, regardless of the length of
the sentence.

GPT3.5 exhibits another failure mode in which it often fails to follow
the precise instruction of using only letters in its response.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

The task is highly trivial for humans, yet both GPT4 and GPT3.5 struggle
with it.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

[eval] Forth Stack Simulator (#351)

with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Forth Stack Simulator

### Eval description

Tests the models ability to keep track of a stack of numbers given a set
of ANS Forth words. The model is asked to respond to a series of numbers
and words with the resulting stack representation. The words used in the
tests are arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and stack operators:
`drop`, `swap`, `rot`, `over`, `dup`, `2over`, `2drop`, `2swap`, `2dup`,
`nip`. The prompts and expected results on the stack are all less than
15 numbers and words long.

### What makes this a useful eval?

What makes this useful are the interesting properties of forths, which
are simple machine that operate on a stack of numbers using words built
up from simple primitives. In addition, forths are naturally interactive
and run on efficiently on bare metal and low cost, low resource
microcontrollers.

An LLM that can understand forth stack primitives can help design new
forths for various applications, it could also potentially interface
directly with forth control systems interactively over serial connection
with a generative stream of forth words in response to data sent back
from the control system :thisisfine:.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [ ] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

Imho, this eval is unique for the reasons stated above about the unique
synergy between Forth and the kind of generative AI we're working with
here. Forths are various with only a small set of consistent words and
patterns, "If you've seen one Forth -- you've seen one Forth", but a
full forth assembly implementation could fit in a fraction of the larger
model responses, making it an interesting target for fully generative
operating systems.

Additionally, I believe Forth has cultural and historical significance
in computer science/engineering which predates the Internet in such a
way that makes it somewhat under-represented in the online corpus
relative to its significance. A model of all human knowledge should have
a strong grasp on how it works.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name

belarusian-lexicon

### Eval description

Test the model's ability to distinguish between existing and
hallucinated Belarusian words.

### What makes this a useful eval?

While the multilingual capability of recent GPT models is impressive,
there is still room for improvement. Many human languages are lagging
far behind English in terms of the model's ability to answer questions
and produce coherent texts in these languages, and the model's
"knowledge" of their lexicon and grammar is, to some extent,
hallucinated. One example is Belarusian, an East Slavic language spoken
by several million people. In my experience with ChatGPT, when the model
is prompted in Belarusian, its responses are sometimes ungrammatical or
semantically incoherent, and very often they contain made-up words – a
possible sign of overgeneralization based on Russian and Ukrainian data,
which are much more
[abundant](https://commoncrawl.github.io/cc-crawl-statistics/plots/languages)
on the web than Belarusian.

This eval contains 150 pairs of single-word prompts: one item in each
pair is a non-word hallucinated by ChatGPT (either totally meaningless
in Belarusian or violating the language's orthographic and phonetic
rules), and another item is an actual Belarusian word with similar
spelling. The model's task is to distinguish between words and
non-words. ChatGPT tends to label most items as existing words,
therefore its accuracy appears to be around 50%, and the negative-class
F measure is very low. Any competent speaker of Belarusian would perform
much better, and a language-specific tool, such as [this spell
checker](https://corpus.by/SpellChecker) or [this grammatical
database](https://bnkorpus.info/grammar.en.html) of Belarusian (also
available for
[download](https://github.com/Belarus/GrammarDB/releases)), would
flawlessly identify non-words.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This eval an attempt to point out specific deficiencies in the model's
ability to handle a lower-resource language (Belarusian). As such, it
might not only benchmark future refinements of Belarusian language
capability in the GPT models, but also serve as an instructuve example
for other language communities.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Use the same ABI for static and shared libraries on non-Windows platforms (#12983)

Hi,

It seems that until last year, the logic behind `PROTOBUF_USE_DLLS` was for Windows (MSCV) only. It was changed to all platforms here in https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/5a0887fc6529596eff5c0f72febc602a9d494cc2

Last month, the generated pkg config files were updated to reflect the protobuf build-time value of `PROTOBUF_USE_DLLS` as it was indeed noted that it changes the ABI. This was done in https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/pull/12700 In the commit message it is mentionned that most likely we shall rather have a stable ABI.

Finally in https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/12746 which at some point mentions https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/283987730#comment7 where a Google employee hits the linker issue:
```
undefined reference to `google::protobuf::internal::ThreadSafeArena::thread_cache_'
```
which denotes a mix of some .o or libs built `PROTOBUF_USE_DLLS` defined and some others build with `PROTOBUF_USE_DLLS` undefined, resulting in ABI incompatibilities.

I also hit this issue while trying to include protobuf in a corporate environment using it's own proprietary build system in which it is expected that .a and .so use a compatible ABI.

From my own understanding, ideally we should always use `thread_local` variables, but experience has shown that:
 - old iOS (iOS < 9) didn't seem to accept `thread_local`, leading to the `GOOGLE_PROTOBUF_NO_THREADLOCAL` macro later renamed `PROTOBUF_NO_THREADLOCAL` which allowed to disable this, but it is not set anywhere in the protobuf code base. Also I doubt you still want to support such old iOS now, so maybe you should consider removing all `PROTOBUF_NO_THREADLOCAL` related code paths (this pull request doesn't do this).
  - MSVC's DLL interface doesn't seem to accept exporting thread local variables (at least from what I understood, I know absolutely nothing about the Windows ecosystem), yet we can "hide" a thread local variable in a static function using a thread local variable. However in that case the access to TLS variable is not inlined, leading to worse performances, this hack shall be done only for Windows (actually when using MSVC) *AND* we build a shared library.
  - In all other cases, a classical `thread_local` shall be used, no matter if we build a static or a shared library. In particular on Linux which I guess is the target Google cares the more about for its own production. This pull request achieves this.

Am I right in my conclusion ?

Closes #12983

[MIRROR] Drunk slurring scales based on how drunk you are [MDB IGNORE] (#21247)

* Drunk slurring scales based on how drunk you are (#75459)

## About The Pull Request

The strength of the slurring effect drunkness applies on you now scales
based on how drunk you are.

Being "a little" drunk still changes your saymod, and makes you
occasionally slur your words...

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/51863163/1b21b359-a1f9-428a-8e10-d2028ac59728)

But being "a lot" drunk kicks it up to 11

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/51863163/9d593c80-75ff-4d02-8e7c-e48c738154bb)

Additionally, drunk slurring was separated into "generic slurring" and
"drunk slurring", the former which does not scale but less closely
resembles drunkness. Generic slurring is used in places such as
concussions, so this is an added bonus.

As a result of the split, I had to update mind restoration. Now it heals
all types of slurring, which does include cult slurs.

## Why It's Good For The Game

I, and many other people, always found it very annoying when you became
completely illegible from taking one sip of a drink. This seeks to amend
that by making low levels of drunkness still for the most part be
legible and sane. Average drunkness is roughly the same / equal to the
old slurring effect, while "very drunk" is even more illegible and silly
(which I find funny).

This has the added bonus of separating out "drunk slurring" and "generic
slurring", allowing effects to slur your words without going full ham on
drunkness (burping and "huhh"s).

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
add: When you are drunk, the strength of your slurring now varies based
on how drunk you are. Being "a little drunk" only rarely slurs your
words, being average drunk is the same as the old effect, while being
very drunk now slurs your words even more.
add: Some non-alcohol sources of slurring, such as concussions, now give
"generic slurring" rather than "drunk slurring", which less resemble
being drunk (ie, no burping).
add: Mind restoration now heals ALL slurring, rather than only drunk
slurring (which includes cult / heretic slurring).
/:cl:

* Drunk slurring scales based on how drunk you are

Elementizes and Greyscales blood decals/overlays (#1882)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
This PR converts our blood decals to elements, and adds greyscale
capability to blood, tied to species DNA.
Ports:
https://github.com/BeeStation/BeeStation-Hornet/pull/3111
https://github.com/BeeStation/BeeStation-Hornet/pull/3046
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/61610
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/59873
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/59315
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/53109

Some others, I don't quite remember. Mostly related fixes for those PRs.
<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game

Decals as a component is a cause of some lag, apparently. This should
alleviate some if it's even noticeable.

Species having a framework for unique, greyscale blood colors can add a
lot for our lore and visual feel.
<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would
benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be
worth adding. -->

## Changelog

:cl:
add: Elzu now bleed, but do not have Liquid Electricity reagent as
blood. (will be changed in the future)
add: IPCs now "bleed" by leaking coolant
add: Sarathi now have teal-colored blood.
add: Blood will now dry over time
add: New bloody footprint sprites from bay
refactor: Refactors a lot of blood code
/:cl:

<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put
your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your
GitHub username as author ingame. -->
<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the
icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags,
changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by
the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->

makes snow legions from portals drop skeletons (like tendril legions) (#75707)

## About The Pull Request
Exactly what it says on the tin (snow legions only dropping ashen
skeletons, like tendril legions).

Also changes the name of the "fromtendril" variable to "from_spawner",
and comments it. Not sure if that warrants a changelong comment, but
I'll go ahead and assume no.

## Why It's Good For The Game
being able to farm snow legion portals for an endless tide of bodies
and/or equipment is a bit weird. also puts it a bit more in line with
the legions of Lavaland

## Changelog

:cl:
balance: The source of the demonic portals that endlessly deposits snow
legions onto the Icemoon no longer preserves the bodies nor gear of the
damned (read: demon portal snow legions now only drop skeletons).

Allows Export of your Preferences JSON File (#75014)

## About The Pull Request

Hey there,

This was spoken about in #70492 (specifically
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/70492#issuecomment-1278069607),
and I have been waiting for this to be implemented for some time. It
never got implemented, so I decided to code it myself.

Basically, **if the server host doesn't disable it**, you are free to
export your JSONs as a player, right from the stat-panel. It's a pretty
JSON on 515 versions, too!

It's right here:


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34697715/235251447-1c977718-51fd-4025-8d89-c60bffc379ec.png)

Here's what the prettified JSON looks like on 515.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34697715/235321061-4a217e26-c082-4bba-b54a-2c780defda0a.png)

There's a cooldown (default to 10 seconds) between exporting your
preferences.

#### Why is this config?

It's because in the past, a server host could always just file-share the
.sav or .json or whatever to the player, but they would have to do the
explicit option of actually bothering to make the files accessible to
the player. In that same line of logic, the server operator will have to
explicitly make the files accessible. This is mostly because I'm not
sure how good `ftp()` is at being a player function and wanted to have
some sort of cap/control somehow in case an exploit vector is detected
or it's just plain spammed by bots, so we'll just leave it up to the
direct providers of this data to elect if they wish to provide the data
or not.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Players don't have to log into Server A to remember what hairstyle they
loved using when they want to swap to Server B! That's amazing actually.
I always forget what ponytail my character has, and it'll be nice to
have the hairstyle in a readily accessible place (after I prettify the
JSON for myself).

It's also more convenient for server hosts to make player data like this
accessible if they really want to, too.

If we ever add an _import_ feature in the future (which would have to be
done with a LOT of care), this will also be useful. I wouldn't advise it
though having taken a precursory look at how much goes into it while
trying to ascertain the scope of this PR.
## Changelog
:cl:
qol: The game now supports export of your preferences into a JSON file!
The verb (export-preferences) should now be available in the OOC tab of
your stat-panel if enabled by server operators.
server: Exporting player preferences is controlled by a configuration
option, 'FORBID_PREFERENCES_EXPORT'. If you do not wish to let clients
access the ftp() function to their own preferences file (probably for
bandwidth reasons?) you should uncomment this or add it to your config
somehow.
config: Server operators are also able to set the cooldown between
requests to download the JSON Preferences file via the
'SECONDS_COOLDOWN_FOR_PREFERENCES_EXPORT' config option.

Replaces the syndicate corpse Legions can drop with one without a MODSuit (#75700)

## About The Pull Request
This is part of a pass I'm working on doing where I go through and
remove instances of antag gear outside of their normal context. This is
mostly going to involve replacing space/Lavaland ruin gear with
something close to the same power level but not distinctly something
only antags should be able to get. I want to keep ruins rewarding but I
don't want explicit antag gear to be something you can obtain without
needing an uplink.

The first part of this is me removing the MODSuit from the syndicate
operative corpse. The new one drops a turtleneck, a syndicate gas mask,
and gripper gloves.

## Why It's Good For The Game
It's my opinion that antag gear should probably stay in antag hands
unless you manage to kill one or steal an uplink. The main impetus for
this was a discussion I had a while back about how blood red hardsuits
used to _just_ be an antag thing. I kind of miss that general feeling of
paranoia that came from seeing someone wearing it, as opposed to seeing
it these days and just thinking "Yeah, it's probably someone who got it
from space".

In this specific instance, Syndicate MODSuits are pretty strong anyway
and, regardless of the low odds of getting one, I really don't think it
should be available as loot off a fairly easy-to-kill mob.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Syndicate corpses dropped from killing a Legion no longer come
with a MODSuit.

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, pelase note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
rhetorical-devices

### Eval description

Evaluates model's ability to select the most specific rhetorical
modification of a sentence from a multiple choice with a large number of
nuanced rhetorical devices.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Useful for using LLMs to write novels and generate consistent/parametric
authorial tone.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite

- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

Add Eval: Internal Representations via Counting (#1006)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Internal representations via counting

### Eval description

Using series of logical questions that require multiple (simple)
manipulations of numbers to get the ideal answer. These are basic tasks
that should be doable by an LLM, but require several steps of internal
"thought" to get right.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Situations with number manipulation with multiple steps are prevalent
anywhere in the modern world. Testing the internal representation of the
LLM can provide other insights on how well its "mind" processes
information.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This eval is capable of providing insight into the LLM's internal
representation of objects versus answering fact-based questions or
straightforward complex logic puzzles.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
`norwegian-lexicon`

### Eval description

This eval uses valid Norwegian words taken from the dictionary and
assesses whether GPT can recognize them as valid.

### What makes this a useful eval?

The Norwegian language is simple yet complicated at the same time. There
are a lot of words that are valid Norwegian words that do not get
recognized anymore. An AI should be able to identify these words with
precision. All of the words used in the samples are valid Norwegian
words and can be found in the dictionary. After assessing GPT-4 (through
the playground) and GPT-3.5 -- it failed to recognize most of the words.
Some of the words would return positive during some evals. Other times
it wouldn't recognize them. After asking GPT why it is not a valid word,
it would apologize and fix its mistake.

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,

mm: get rid of 'vmalloc_info' from /proc/meminfo

It turns out that at least some versions of glibc end up reading
/proc/meminfo at every single startup, because glibc wants to know the
amount of memory the machine has.  And while that's arguably insane,
it's just how things are.

And it turns out that it's not all that expensive most of the time, but
the vmalloc information statistics (amount of virtual memory used in the
vmalloc space, and the biggest remaining chunk) can be rather expensive
to compute.

The 'get_vmalloc_info()' function actually showed up on my profiles as
4% of the CPU usage of "make test" in the git source repository, because
the git tests are lots of very short-lived shell-scripts etc.

It turns out that apparently this same silly vmalloc info gathering
shows up on the facebook servers too, according to Dave Jones.  So it's
not just "make test" for git.

We had two patches to just cache the information (one by me, one by
Ingo) to mitigate this issue, but the whole vmalloc information of of
rather dubious value to begin with, and people who *actually* want to
know what the situation is wrt the vmalloc area should just look at the
much more complete /proc/vmallocinfo instead.

In fact, according to my testing - and perhaps more importantly,
according to that big search engine in the sky: Google - there is
nothing out there that actually cares about those two expensive fields:
VmallocUsed and VmallocChunk.

So let's try to just remove them entirely.  Actually, this just removes
the computation and reports the numbers as zero for now, just to try to
be minimally intrusive.

If this breaks anything, we'll obviously have to re-introduce the code
to compute this all and add the caching patches on top.  But if given
the option, I'd really prefer to just remove this bad idea entirely
rather than add even more code to work around our historical mistake
that likely nobody really cares about.

WebXR: Severe aliasing in WebXR experiences (with WebGL1 contexts)
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=256861
rdar://109424254

Reviewed by Dan Glastonbury.

WebXR sessions using WebGL1 contexts are unable to turn on
multisampling. I'm pretty sure this was my fault, but I can't
remember if it was intentional or a mistake. Either way it is
a bug.

Fix this by implementing the multisample renderbuffer creation
and resolution steps. Since we're doing this on a WebGL1 context,
the normal API will be invalid (it requires GLES3), so call the
extension API instead. This means we need to expose some extra methods
on GraphicsContextGL.

Lastly, the framebuffer textures we get are SRGB8_ALPHA8 which
requires an extension to be enabled with a WebGL1 context when
we're talking to an XR-compatible context. Similarly, we
enable the extension to allow multisampled framebuffers.

torch.compiler public namespace (#102182)

# torch.compiler public API

## Goal

The goal of this document is to describe the public facing API for torchdynamo and torchinductor.

Today both dynamo and torchinductor are in `torch/_dynamo` and `torch/_inductor` namespace with the only public function

`torch.compile()` which is directly placed in `torch/__init__.py`

This poses a few problems for users trying to take dependencies on PyTorch 2.0
1. Unclear BC guarantees
2. No builtin discovery mechanism outside of reading the source code
3. No hard requirements for docstrings or type annotations

Most importantly it mixes two personas the PyTorch 2.0 developer vs the PyTorch 2.0 customer so this is an attempt to address this. We draw a lot of inspiration from the `functorch` migration to the `func` namespace.

## Alternate names

We did discuss some other alternative names

1. `torch.compile` -> problem is this would break BC on the existing `torch.compile` function
2. `torch.dynamo` -> `dynamo` is so far not something we've deliberately hidden from users but problem is now figuring out what it's `_dynamo` vs `dynamo` might be confusing
3. `torch.compiler` -> 1 would be better but to keep BC this is a good compromise

# The general approach
## Proposal 1
In https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_dynamo/__init__.py

We have function called `reset()`, this function is essential if users are trying to `torch.compile()` a model under different settings

```python
# in _dynamo/
def reset():
    do_reset_stuff()
```

Instead we propose

```python
# in compiler/
def reset():
    do_reset_stuff() # As in copy paste the logic from _dynamo.reset

# in _dynamo/
import warnings
import inspect

def reset():
    function_name = inspect.currentframe().f_code.co_name
    warnings.warn(f"{function_name} is deprecated, use compiler.{function_name} instead", DeprecationWarning)
    return compiler.reset()

```
## Proposal 2

```python
# in compiler/
def reset():
    “””
    Docstrings here
    “””
    _dynamo.reset()

# in _dynamo/
No changes
```
Consensus so far seems to be proposal 2 since fewer warnings will be less jarring and it’ll make it quite easy to merge the public API

## Docstrings

The above was an example of a function that has no inputs or outputs but there are other functions which could use an improvement in their docstrings, for example allow_in_graph actually works over lists of functions but that’s not mentioned anywhere in the example only if you read the source code.

def allow_in_graph(fn):
    """
    Customize which functions TorchDynamo will include in the generated
    graph. Similar to `torch.fx.wrap()`.

    Parameters:
        fn (callable or list/tuple): The function(s) to be allowed in the graph.

    Returns:
        callable or list/tuple: The input function(s) included in the graph.

    Examples:
        Customize inclusion of a single function:
        ::
            torch._dynamo.allow_in_graph(my_custom_function)

        Customize inclusion of multiple functions:
        ::
            torch._dynamo.allow_in_graph([my_custom_function1, my_custom_function2])

        @torch._dynamo.optimize(...)
        def fn(a):
            x = torch.add(x, 1)
            x = my_custom_function(x)
            x = torch.add(x, 1)
            return x

        fn(...)

    Notes:
        The `allow_in_graph` function allows customization of which functions TorchDynamo
        includes in the generated graph. It can be used to include specific functions that
        are not automatically captured by TorchDynamo.

        If `fn` is a list or tuple, `allow_in_graph` will be called recursively on each
        element in the sequence.

        Once a function is allowed in the graph using `allow_in_graph`, it will be captured
        in the graph generated by TorchDynamo. This customization enables more fine-grained
        control over the functions included in the graph.

        Note that `allow_in_graph` expects the input `fn` to be a callable.

    """
    if isinstance(fn, (list, tuple)):
        return [allow_in_graph(x) for x in fn]
    assert callable(fn), "allow_in_graph expects a callable"
    allowed_functions._allowed_function_ids.add(id(fn))
    allowed_functions._disallowed_function_ids.remove(id(fn))
    return fn

So to make the API public, we’d have to write similar docstrings for all public functions we’d like to create.

The benefit of this approach is that
1. No BC risks, internal and external users relying on our tooling can slowly wean off the private functions.
2. We will also have to write correct docstrings which will automatically make our documentation easier to maintain and render correctly on pytorch.org
3. We already have some BC guarantees already, we don’t kill OptimizedModule, we rejected the PR to change the config system

The con of this approach is that
Will be stuck with some potentially suboptimal functions/classes that you can’t kill

## Testing strategy
If the approach is to mostly make a public function call an already tested private function then all we need to do is ensure that the function signatures don't change

## Which functions should be in the public API

Our heuristic for deciding whether something should be public or not is are users already relying on it for lack of other options or have we recommended some non public functions for users to debug their PT 2.0 programs.

Heuristic for not putting something in public is that it’s an experimental subsystem with the goal of turning it on by default, it’s very core dev centric, meta centric, a bunch of different configs that should be batched into a single user facing one, or something that needs to be renamed because the name is confusing

#### Top level
`torch.compile()` -> already is a public API it does require some minor improvements like having configs be passed in to any backend and not just inductor (EDIT: This was already done https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/99645l) and renaming `mode=reduce-overhead` to `mode=cudagraph`

To make sure that PT 2.0 is supported with a given pytorch version users can create a new public function and this would replace the need for `try/except` blocks around `import torch._dynamo` that has been populating user code.

```python
def pt2_enabled():
    if hasattr(torch, 'compile'):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

For all of the below they will be translated to `torch.compiler.function_name()`

#### From _dynamo

As a starting point we looked at https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_dynamo/__init__.py and we suggest redefining these functions in `pytorch/torch/compiler/__init__.py`

It might also make sense to split them over multiple files and import them in `__init__.py` but because the number of functions is small it'd probably be fine to add them all into a single compiler/__init__.py until this list becomes larger

1. `reset()`
2. `allow_in_graph()`
10. `list_backends()`
12. `compile()`:  torch.compile() would be mostly a shell function passing arguments to torch.compiler.compile()
13. `assume_constant_result()`: TODO: Double check how this is useful
15. `torch._dynamo.disable()`

Some notable omissions
11. `explain()`: We need to clean up the output for this function, make it a data class and pretty printable
1. `forbid_in_graph()`: Considered adding this but should instead consolidate on `disallow_in_graph`
2. `optimize_assert()`: Already covered by `torch.compile(fullgraph=True)`
3. `check_if_dynamo_supported()`: this would be supplanted by pt2_enabled()
4. `compilation_metrics`, `graph_breaks_reasons` ..: would all be accessed via `torch.compiler.explain()`
5. `replay` does not seem useful to end customers
6. . `graph_break()`: Mostly useful for debugging or unit tests
9. `register_backend()`: End users will just pass a string backend to torch.compile, only devs will create new backends
10. `export()` : Eventually this needs to public but for now it’s not ready so just highlighting that it will be in the public API eventually
11. `disallow_in_graph()`: Usage is limited
12. `mark_static()`: we can keep this private until dynamic=True is recommended in stable
13. `mark_dynamic()`:  we can keep this private until dynamic=True is recommended in trunk
14. 8. `OptimizedModule`: This is the only class that we'd expose but is crucial since users are running code like `if isinstance(mod, OptimizedModule): torch.save(mod._orig_mod)` EDIT: because we fixed pickling we no longer need to
expose this
15. `is_compiling()`: Still not clear how this useful to end users

There are also config variables which we need to expose https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_dynamo/config.py

Some of our configs are useful dev flags, others are to gate experimental functionality and others are essential debugging tools and we seperate out the essential debugging and logging tools to a public facing config.

TODO: I still need to think of a good way of porting the config in a BC way here are some ideas
1. Just make all passes available and controllable via `torch.compile(options={})` but only show docstrings for the ones users should care about.

The current problem with our config system is we have 3 ways of setting them once via `options={}`, environment variables and variables in `config.py`, it'd be worth settling on one source of truth and have that be the public API.

The configs we should make public are
1. `log_file_name`
2. `verbose`
3. `cache_size_limit`
4. `repro_level` and `repro_after`: Although we can rename these to minifier and give human readable names to the levels

Everything else should stay private in particular

1. `print_graph_breaks`, `print_specializations`: should be supplanted by `explain()` for public users
2. dynamic shape configs : Users should only have to worry about `torch.compile(dynamic=True/False)`
3. The distributed flags, hook or guard configs: If we tell a user to use FSDP and DDP then the flag should be enabled by default or be in a private namespace
4. The fbcode flags: Obviously no need to be user facing
5. Skip/Allow lists: Not something normal users should play around with

#### From _inductor
Very little of inductor should be exposed in a public facing API, our core audience as in people writing models mostly just need information on what certain passes mean and how to control them a high level and they can do this with `torch.compile(options={})` so the goal here should be more to make available passes clearer and ideally consolidate them into `torch.compile()` docstrings or modes.

There are some exceptions though from https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_inductor/__init__.py

1. `list_mode_options()`
2. `list_options()`: this needs an additional pass to hide internal or debug options

For both of these we’d rename them to compiler.inductor_list_mode_options and compiler.inductor_list_options() since they would be in the same init file as the one for dynamo

Notable omissions
1. `_inductor.compile()`: Because of users are coming in with their own fx graph, they are likely developers
2. `_inductor.aot_compile()`:Again this is about capturing and modifying fx graphs so users APIs don't need to be public

However the configs are a slightly different story, because we can choose to either
1. Make all configs public
2. Make some configs public and keep most of the private ones. If public config is set it should override the private version
3. Make all configs controllable via `torch.compile(options={})` but make list_options() hide more things

For now 3 seems like the most reasonable choice with some high level configs we’ll keep like TORCH_COMPILE_DEBUG

Regardless here's what should probably be public or advertised more
1. `disable_progress` and verbose_progress:  Combine and enable by default
2. `fallback_random`: We could make the case this shouldn't be public if a top level deterministic mode enables this
3. `profile_bandwidth`: Or could make the case that this should be in TORCH_COMPILE_DEBUG

Notable omissions
1. Any config that would generally improve performance for most that we should probably enable by default but might be disabled in the short term because of stability: example `epilogue_fusion`, `pattern_matcher`, `reordering`
2. Autotuning flags: Should just sit behind `torch.compile(mode="max-autotune")` like `max_autotune`, `max_autotune_gemm`
3. `coordinate_descent_tuning`: This one I'm a but mixed about, maybe it just also fall into `mode="max-autotune"`
4. `trace`: `TORCH_COMPILE_DEBUG` is the best flag for all of this
5. `triton.cudagraphs`: Default should be `torch.compile(mode="reduce-overhead")` - I'd go further and rename the `mode=cudagraph` and we can keep reduce-overhead for BC reasons
6. `triton_unique_kernel_names`: Mostly useful for devs debugging
7. `dce`: which doesnt really do anything
8. `shape_padding`: Elias is working on enabling this by default in which case we also remove it

## Mechanics

This PR would include the public functions with their docstrings

Another PR will take a stab at the configs

And for work where the APIs are still being cleaned up whether its minifier or escape hatches, export or dynamic shapes, aot_inductor etc.. we’ll keep them private until a public commitment can be made

Changes syndicate surgery duffelbags to contain advanced tools (#75846)

## About The Pull Request

Changes syndicate surgery duffelbags to contain advanced tools.

In total, they contain
- All advanced surgical tools, alongside the normal ones without an
advanced version
- Sterilizine gel
- Bone gel and surgical tape
- Roller bed
- Straight jacket, muzzle, and MMI

Changed the Syndicate Infiltrators' surgery areas to contain a full
syndicate surgery duffelbag.

The normal infiltrator now has a operating computer and a closet of
misc. surgical clothing and anesthesic tank.

## Why It's Good For The Game

> Changes syndicate surgery duffelbags to contain advanced tools.

> In total, they contain (...)

The only real reason to buy this item is for the increased storage space
the duffelbag gives, and I find that a little sad. Surgical tools are
plentiful, as they can either be lathed from cargo, medbay, or just
taken. A surgeon, the role that *should* thematically need this the
most, has absolutely no reason to take it. Now they do! A full set of
advanced tools is certainly something that can be considered for
purchase, especially with all the bonus items in here - which might just
allow a traitor to repair their bones if they're heavily wanted and
licking their wounds in maintenance. The TC cost has been increased to 4
to compensate.

> Changed the Syndicate Infiltrators' surgery areas to contain a full
syndicate surgery duffelbag.

Similar to above, but instead, the reasoning is that nukies really do
not have a lot of time to do surgery. A lot of the 20 minutes of prep
time in War is spent figuring out what you're buying with your
exorbitant amount of TC, in non-War you don't really want to delay the
mission for five minutes for surgery, and its hassle means that most
people do not really want to bother with things like nerve threading,
etc. due to the large, annoying time cost.

> The normal infiltrator now has a operating computer and a closet of
misc. surgical clothing and anesthesic tank.

The former is because, well, what the hell, why didn't it have one!
Removing the loose tools gave me the space for it. The latter is just me
realizing that empty closet is weird and lame and so I gave it some
fluff contents to give it a reason to exist.

## Changelog

Fixes colossus possessor crystal cockroaches/animals not dumping the user's body upon death/gibbing (#75843)

## About The Pull Request
Hooks the stasis closet thingamajing into `COMSIG_LIVING_DEATH` instead
of checking the animal's stat on `process()`, which makes possessed
animals properly dump the stasis closet's contents upon death or gibbing
(which is death but cooler).
yeah uh this method is hilarious but it does protect the user's body
quite reliably at least lol

## Why It's Good For The Game
Fixes #75829
also probably makes cockroach death saner in some unreported way, this
`. = ..()` vs `..()` is above my non-existent paygrade but it keeps
popping up from time to time

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: gibbing colossus possessor crystal possessed animals will no longer
stick the user's body and their stuff into the shadow realm. the animals
will properly drop your corpse when killed or gibbed

Warrior Nerf (#3424)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->

# About the pull request

This PR removes cooldown reduction on slash.

This PR slightly lowers fling and punch cooldowns.

This PR lowers fling stun to a micro stun and adds a slow.

This PR decreases lunge range to 4 tiles.

As a reminder design feedback and balance concerns go here:
https://forum.cm-ss13.com/w/pr-feedback/steps/step_1

# Explain why it's good for the game

Warrior rework has been on my mind for a while. I'm not quite sure how I
want to do it. The cooldowns on abilities and the abilities themselves
are incredibly powerful crowd control and just a few warriors can do
immense damage to large groups of marines. It's just... not in a great
place for a T2 and sadly I don't have a thorough game plan yet to rework
it into something more bearable while equally enjoyable to play. In the
mean time, this is what we're getting. Am I promising a rework in the
near future? Not really. It's on my list somewhere. Does warrior need
some changing around? Yeah.

Overall, this should make warrior a bit more bearable. We'll see. More
changes as testing goes.

Hand-implementing incoming "stream" futures

As much as I wanted to make select_biased work, I just couldn't. The
example was hanging with the previous implementation, and my attempts at
fixing it were fruitless without also breaking the unit tests.

I decided to try to hand rolling the futures, and magically, everything
worked. Because Accept isn't Unpin, it's a little ugly and requires a
Box::pin currently. I don't love having that allocation there, but I
couldn't figure out how to get the right access through pin_project, and
I know this approach is 100% safe. It probably can be done safely
without the allocation, however, as the only time that the accept field
needs to be overwritten is after the future has been polled -- thus the
Pin is not longer being used.

I feel like this logic should have been able to be representable with
select/select_biased, which might avoid the issue entirely, as pin!
seemingly was able to deal Accept being Unpin, since it was being stored
on the stack. However, I failed to get the logic to get both the example
*and* the unit test working at the same time.

mm: vmscan: fix extreme overreclaim and swap floods

commit f53af4285d775cd9a9a146fc438bd0a1bee1838a upstream.

During proactive reclaim, we sometimes observe severe overreclaim, with
several thousand times more pages reclaimed than requested.

This trace was obtained from shrink_lruvec() during such an instance:

    prio:0 anon_cost:1141521 file_cost:7767
    nr_reclaimed:4387406 nr_to_reclaim:1047 (or_factor:4190)
    nr=[7161123 345 578 1111]

While he reclaimer requested 4M, vmscan reclaimed close to 16G, most of it
by swapping.  These requests take over a minute, during which the write()
to memory.reclaim is unkillably stuck inside the kernel.

Digging into the source, this is caused by the proportional reclaim
bailout logic.  This code tries to resolve a fundamental conflict: to
reclaim roughly what was requested, while also aging all LRUs fairly and
in accordance to their size, swappiness, refault rates etc.  The way it
attempts fairness is that once the reclaim goal has been reached, it stops
scanning the LRUs with the smaller remaining scan targets, and adjusts the
remainder of the bigger LRUs according to how much of the smaller LRUs was
scanned.  It then finishes scanning that remainder regardless of the
reclaim goal.

This works fine if priority levels are low and the LRU lists are
comparable in size.  However, in this instance, the cgroup that is
targeted by proactive reclaim has almost no files left - they've already
been squeezed out by proactive reclaim earlier - and the remaining anon
pages are hot.  Anon rotations cause the priority level to drop to 0,
which results in reclaim targeting all of anon (a lot) and all of file
(almost nothing).  By the time reclaim decides to bail, it has scanned
most or all of the file target, and therefor must also scan most or all of
the enormous anon target.  This target is thousands of times larger than
the reclaim goal, thus causing the overreclaim.

The bailout code hasn't changed in years, why is this failing now?  The
most likely explanations are two other recent changes in anon reclaim:

1. Before the series starting with commit 5df741963d52 ("mm: fix LRU
   balancing effect of new transparent huge pages"), the VM was
   overall relatively reluctant to swap at all, even if swap was
   configured. This means the LRU balancing code didn't come into play
   as often as it does now, and mostly in high pressure situations
   where pronounced swap activity wouldn't be as surprising.

2. For historic reasons, shrink_lruvec() loops on the scan targets of
   all LRU lists except the active anon one, meaning it would bail if
   the only remaining pages to scan were active anon - even if there
   were a lot of them.

   Before the series starting with commit ccc5dc67340c ("mm/vmscan:
   make active/inactive ratio as 1:1 for anon lru"), most anon pages
   would live on the active LRU; the inactive one would contain only a
   handful of preselected reclaim candidates. After the series, anon
   gets aged similarly to file, and the inactive list is the default
   for new anon pages as well, making it often the much bigger list.

   As a result, the VM is now more likely to actually finish large
   anon targets than before.

Change the code such that only one SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX-sized nudge toward the
larger LRU lists is made before bailing out on a met reclaim goal.

This fixes the extreme overreclaim problem.

Fairness is more subtle and harder to evaluate.  No obvious misbehavior
was observed on the test workload, in any case.  Conceptually, fairness
should primarily be a cumulative effect from regular, lower priority
scans.  Once the VM is in trouble and needs to escalate scan targets to
make forward progress, fairness needs to take a backseat.  This is also
acknowledged by the myriad exceptions in get_scan_count().  This patch
makes fairness decrease gradually, as it keeps fairness work static over
increasing priority levels with growing scan targets.  This should make
more sense - although we may have to re-visit the exact values.

#### Wednesday 2023-06-07 05:37:29 by leycec

**Beartype 0.14.1** released.

This patch release delivers enthusiastic ~~hijinx~~ quality assurance
with improved support for [third-party `typing_extensions`
backports](https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions), [PEP 517][PEP
517] (i.e., `pyproject.toml`), [PEP 544][PEP 544] (i.e.,
`typing.Protocol`), and [PEP 585][PEP 585] (i.e., `re.Match` and
`re.Pattern`). Codebases everywhere can now release a grateful sigh of
relief as bugs buckle under the combined might of @beartype **+**
`typing_extensions`. Flex the muscles you knew you always had.

This patch release resolves **3 issues.** Wave those paws in the air
like your project manager just don't care!

## Compatibility Improved

* **[PEP 517][PEP 517].** This release restores our
  [PEP 517][PEP 517]-compliant top-level `pyproject.toml` file in a vain
  and probably misguided attempt to restore the buildability of our
  documentation on the third-party ReadTheDocs (RTD) documentation host.
  Doing so nudges @beartype mildly closer towards abandoning the
  antiquated (and frankly objectionable) `setuptools` build system to
  Hatch, officially endorsed by the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) as
  sane and *not* `setuptools`, which are the only criteria @leycec is
  looking for in a Python build system. The bar could *not* be lower.
* **[PEP 544][PEP 544].** @beartype now officially supports *all*
  third-party `typing_extensions.Protocol` backports, resolving issue
  #241 kindly submitted by MIT machine learning guru @rsokl (Ryan
  Soklaski). This release also restores testing of the
  `typing_extensions.Protocol` superclass, which now passes under *all*
  `typing_extensions` versions. Let's not ask prying and uncomfortable
  questions about what exactly was resolved here, because then @leycec
  might break down and openly weep emoji tears live on GitHub.
* **[PEP 585][PEP 585].** This release "undeprecates" the
  `beartype.typing.{Match,Pattern}` type hints deprecated by [PEP
  585][PEP 585], resolving issue #240 kindly submitted by AI King
  @KyleKing (Kyle King). Specifically, the `beartype.typing` subpackage
  now imports those type hints from the standard `re` rather than
  `typing` module under Python >= 3.9. This is why @leycec sighs in his
  sleep while clutching a Bengal plushy.

## Documentation Improved

* **[PEP 673][PEP 673] FAQ entry.** This release documents why [PEP
  673][PEP 673] (i.e., `typing.Self`) officially supported by @beartype
  ≥ 0.14.0 is the substantially superior choice to either [PEP
  484][PEP 484]-compliant forward references or [PEP 563][PEP
  563]-compliant postponed type hints for type-checking a class
  self-referentially. Specifically, this release adds a [new "...the
  current class?" question to our existing
  FAQ](https://beartype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/#the-current-class).
  In theory, this *should* clear up the smelly mountain of confusion
  surrounding this topic both on and off our issue tracker.
* **Project URL generalization.** This release generalizes project URLs
  in our Sphinx configuration from the Sphinx-specific `doc/src/conf.py`
  script to the Sphinx-agnostic `beartype.meta` submodule, enabling
  generic reuse of those URLs across numerous third-party frameworks
  rather than merely Sphinx. In short, nothing worthwhile was done.

    [PEP 484]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0484
    [PEP 517]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0517
    [PEP 544]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0544

[MIRROR] Microing var/static times (~0.015 seconds of init) [MDB IGNORE] (#20688)

* Microing var/static times (~0.015 seconds of init) (#74769)

## About The Pull Request

Moth and I came up with an affront to god and man, and used it to track
the time spent creating /static (and in theory /global) variables (this
happens right at the start of init)
They cost as a sum about 0.05 seconds btw, at least currently.

```
/datum/timer
    var/key

/datum/timer/New(file, line)
    src.key = "[file]:[line]"

/datum/timer/proc/operator*(x)
    rustg_time_reset(key)
    return x

/datum/timer/proc/operator+(x)
    var/time = rustg_time_microseconds(key)
    world.log << "TIMER: [key]: [time]"
    return x

Regex:
var/static/([\w/]+) =
-> var/static/$1 = (new /datum/timer(__FILE__, __LINE__)) * (new /datum/timer(__FILE__, __LINE__)) +
```

Output on moth's pc looks like this, time in microseconds

[output_sorted.csv](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/files/11241900/output_sorted.csv)

Most of this is either icon_states() memes (which appears to be cached
btw, that's interesting), or a variation on typecacheof()
There is one get_asset_datum call, but that is ALREADY cached and so is
just redundant. That's a good 0.01 seconds saved.

The rest of the time here is slightly more interesting.

The majority of typecacheof() is iterating the output of typesof(), a
byond internal proc that returns a list of types that either are or are
the child of the passed in type.
A decent chunk of time here (0.005 seconds, or 10% of the proc) can be
saved by unrolling the arguments to the proc.
It takes an arbitrary amount of typepaths as input, but we can't like
use arglist() here (cause this is an internal "proc"), so instead we try
a window of args, passing in null if we start to try and take in too
much.
Window size matters, zebra fits better into 4 then 5, especially because
of how grouping needs to work to make this effect happen.
We save about 0.001 for zebra btw, which is around about 7%. It's lower
cause we need to group the paths beforehand I think.

The speedup is minor, but it DOES exist. Plus it's fun.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Microing is a hell of a drug

pybridge: Fix clobbering remote user set in SSH config

When opening a remote host channel without `user`, stop assuming the
current local user name, as that overwrites any `User` field in
the SSH configuration.

Instead, we need to do the opposite: for an unknown host, the UI will
not set a `user` field in the channel options, but for an actual login
attempt with a password it will. We need to treat them as the same
channel in the `self.remotes` map. The C bridge deals with this in
cockpit_router_normalize_host_params() by disregarding the `user` field
if it is equal to the current user name.

This is a rather silly hack for backwards compatibility, but while we
have two bridges, let's rather stay bug-for-bug compatible and clean
this up in the UI only after we drop the C bridge.

There is one extra tweak: `rpartition()` returns an empty string, but
we can't pass that on literally. So turn those into `None`.

Fixes #18714

web/app: remove hover on navbar items to stop focus from being moved (#51739)

The dropdown menu items in the global navbar (Search and, in App,
Feedback) move focus when you hover over them. This is bizarre, ugly,
and most likely a [WCAG
violation](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#focus-order). I spent some time
yesterday and the root cause is that the [Reach menu button we use does
not support hover at all](https://github.com/reach/reach-ui/issues/278)
and we're hacking it by [sending a mousedown event when you hover over
the
button](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/client/web/src/nav/NavBar/NavDropdown.tsx?L58).

There are two options I can think of to mitigate this bug:
1. Get rid of hover events and only open the dropdowns on click. This is
the easiest option, but obviously removes the ease of accessing the menu
for mouse users.
2. Rewrite the dropdown nav items to use a custom menu instead of Reach.
This is more expensive because we have to reimplement lots of a11y stuff
here, but we can have more fine-grained control of different UI flows
for mouse hover vs mouse click vs keyboard users.

I went with the first option following @almeidapaulooliveira's
[feedback](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C0HMGV90V/p1683735888755969?thread_ts=1683734992.157499&cid=C0HMGV90V).

The following changes were applied to `NavDropdown`:

- Removed all hover and touch events; now only a click will open the
menu.
- Removed the split button; now clicking anywhere on the button will
always open the menu.
- Made the mobile home item into a "generic" home item and always
visible when present.
- Made the home item optional (since the Feedback menu item in the
desktop app doesn't have a home item/route).
- Added customizable a11y names; in the past, the only dropdown was the
Search one, but in App we now have Feedback; the a11y labels were still
saying "Search" before this change.

Additionally, the following changes were applied for polish:

- The double-focus ring on the back/forward buttons in the Tauri app has
been fixed
- Styling changes made to simplify code

## Test plan

The global navbar has extensive visual and behavior test coverage.

bpf: Add fd-based tcx multi-prog infra with link support

This work refactors and adds a lightweight extension ("tcx") to the tc BPF
ingress and egress data path side for allowing BPF program management based
on fds via bpf() syscall through the newly added generic multi-prog API.
The main goal behind this work which we also presented at LPC [0] last year
and a recent update at LSF/MM/BPF this year [3] is to support long-awaited
BPF link functionality for tc BPF programs, which allows for a model of safe
ownership and program detachment.

Given the rise in tc BPF users in cloud native environments, this becomes
necessary to avoid hard to debug incidents either through stale leftover
programs or 3rd party applications accidentally stepping on each others toes.
As a recap, a BPF link represents the attachment of a BPF program to a BPF
hook point. The BPF link holds a single reference to keep BPF program alive.
Moreover, hook points do not reference a BPF link, only the application's
fd or pinning does. A BPF link holds meta-data specific to attachment and
implements operations for link creation, (atomic) BPF program update,
detachment and introspection. The motivation for BPF links for tc BPF programs
is multi-fold, for example:

  - From Meta: "It's especially important for applications that are deployed
    fleet-wide and that don't "control" hosts they are deployed to. If such
    application crashes and no one notices and does anything about that, BPF
    program will keep running draining resources or even just, say, dropping
    packets. We at FB had outages due to such permanent BPF attachment
    semantics. With fd-based BPF link we are getting a framework, which allows
    safe, auto-detachable behavior by default, unless application explicitly
    opts in by pinning the BPF link." [1]

  - From Cilium-side the tc BPF programs we attach to host-facing veth devices
    and phys devices build the core datapath for Kubernetes Pods, and they
    implement forwarding, load-balancing, policy, EDT-management, etc, within
    BPF. Currently there is no concept of 'safe' ownership, e.g. we've recently
    experienced hard-to-debug issues in a user's staging environment where
    another Kubernetes application using tc BPF attached to the same prio/handle
    of cls_bpf, accidentally wiping all Cilium-based BPF programs from underneath
    it. The goal is to establish a clear/safe ownership model via links which
    cannot accidentally be overridden. [0,2]

BPF links for tc can co-exist with non-link attachments, and the semantics are
in line also with XDP links: BPF links cannot replace other BPF links, BPF
links cannot replace non-BPF links, non-BPF links cannot replace BPF links and
lastly only non-BPF links can replace non-BPF links. In case of Cilium, this
would solve mentioned issue of safe ownership model as 3rd party applications
would not be able to accidentally wipe Cilium programs, even if they are not
BPF link aware.

Earlier attempts [4] have tried to integrate BPF links into core tc machinery
to solve cls_bpf, which has been intrusive to the generic tc kernel API with
extensions only specific to cls_bpf and suboptimal/complex since cls_bpf could
be wiped from the qdisc also. Locking a tc BPF program in place this way, is
getting into layering hacks given the two object models are vastly different.

We instead implemented the tcx (tc 'express') layer which is an fd-based tc BPF
attach API, so that the BPF link implementation blends in naturally similar to
other link types which are fd-based and without the need for changing core tc
internal APIs. BPF programs for tc can then be successively migrated from classic
cls_bpf to the new tc BPF link without needing to change the program's source
code, just the BPF loader mechanics for attaching is sufficient.

For the current tc framework, there is no change in behavior with this change
and neither does this change touch on tc core kernel APIs. The gist of this
patch is that the ingress and egress hook have a lightweight, qdisc-less
extension for BPF to attach its tc BPF programs, in other words, a minimal
entry point for tc BPF. The name tcx has been suggested from discussion of
earlier revisions of this work as a good fit, and to more easily differ between
the classic cls_bpf attachment and the fd-based one.

For the ingress and egress tcx points, the device holds a cache-friendly array
with program pointers which is separated from control plane (slow-path) data.
Earlier versions of this work used priority to determine ordering and expression
of dependencies similar as with classic tc, but it was challenged that for
something more future-proof a better user experience is required. Hence this
resulted in the design and development of the generic attach/detach/query API
for multi-progs. See prior patch with its discussion on the API design. tcx is
the first user and later we plan to integrate also others, for example, one
candidate is multi-prog support for XDP which would benefit and have the same
'look and feel' from API perspective.

The goal with tcx is to have maximum compatibility to existing tc BPF programs,
so they don't need to be rewritten specifically. Compatibility to call into
classic tcf_classify() is also provided in order to allow successive migration
or both to cleanly co-exist where needed given its all one logical tc layer.
tcx supports the simplified return codes TCX_NEXT which is non-terminating (go
to next program) and terminating ones with TCX_PASS, TCX_DROP, TCX_REDIRECT.
The fd-based API is behind a static key, so that when unused the code is also
not entered. The struct tcx_entry's program array is currently static, but
could be made dynamic if necessary at a point in future. The a/b pair swap
design has been chosen so that for detachment there are no allocations which
otherwise could fail. The work has been tested with tc-testing selftest suite
which all passes, as well as the tc BPF tests from the BPF CI.

Kudos also to Nikolay Aleksandrov and Martin Lau for in-depth early reviews
of this work.

bpf: Add generic attach/detach/query API for multi-progs

This adds a generic layer called bpf_mprog which can be reused by different
attachment layers to enable multi-program attachment and dependency resolution.
In-kernel users of the bpf_mprog don't need to care about the dependency
resolution internals, they can just consume it with few API calls.

The initial idea of having a generic API sparked out of discussion [0] from an
earlier revision of this work where tc's priority was reused and exposed via
BPF uapi as a way to coordinate dependencies among tc BPF programs, similar
as-is for classic tc BPF. The feedback was that priority provides a bad user
experience and is hard to use [1], e.g.:

  I cannot help but feel that priority logic copy-paste from old tc, netfilter
  and friends is done because "that's how things were done in the past". [...]
  Priority gets exposed everywhere in uapi all the way to bpftool when it's
  right there for users to understand. And that's the main problem with it.

  The user don't want to and don't need to be aware of it, but uapi forces them
  to pick the priority. [...] Your cover letter [0] example proves that in
  real life different service pick the same priority. They simply don't know
  any better. Priority is an unnecessary magic that apps _have_ to pick, so
  they just copy-paste and everyone ends up using the same.

The course of the discussion showed more and more the need for a generic,
reusable API where the "same look and feel" can be applied for various other
program types beyond just tc BPF, for example XDP today does not have multi-
program support in kernel, but also there was interest around this API for
improving management of cgroup program types. Such common multi-program
management concept is useful for BPF management daemons or user space BPF
applications coordinating about their attachments.

Both from Cilium and Meta side [2], we've collected the following requirements
for a generic attach/detach/query API for multi-progs which has been implemented
as part of this work:

  - Support prog-based attach/detach and link API
  - Dependency directives (can also be combined):
    - BPF_F_{BEFORE,AFTER} with relative_{fd,id} which can be {prog,link,none}
      - BPF_F_ID flag as {fd,id} toggle
      - BPF_F_LINK flag as {prog,link} toggle
      - If relative_{fd,id} is none, then BPF_F_BEFORE will just prepend, and
        BPF_F_AFTER will just append for the case of attaching
      - Enforced only at attach time
    - BPF_F_{FIRST,LAST}
      - Enforced throughout the bpf_mprog state's lifetime
      - Admin override possible (e.g. link detach, prog-based BPF_F_REPLACE)
  - Internal revision counter and optionally being able to pass expected_revision
  - User space daemon can query current state with revision, and pass it along
    for attachment to assert current state before doing updates
  - Query also gets extension for link_ids array and link_attach_flags:
    - prog_ids are always filled with program IDs
    - link_ids are filled with link IDs when link was used, otherwise 0
    - {prog,link}_attach_flags for holding {prog,link}-specific flags
  - Must be easy to integrate/reuse for in-kernel users

The uapi-side changes needed for supporting bpf_mprog are rather minimal,
consisting of the additions of the attachment flags, revision counter, and
expanding existing union with relative_{fd,id} member.

The bpf_mprog framework consists of an bpf_mprog_entry object which holds
an array of bpf_mprog_fp (fast-path structure) and bpf_mprog_cp (control-path
structure). Both have been separated, so that fast-path gets efficient packing
of bpf_prog pointers for maximum cache efficieny. Also, array has been chosen
instead of linked list or other structures to remove unnecessary indirections
for a fast point-to-entry in tc for BPF. The bpf_mprog_entry comes as a pair
via bpf_mprog_bundle so that in case of updates the peer bpf_mprog_entry
is populated and then just swapped which avoids additional allocations that
could otherwise fail, for example, in detach case. bpf_mprog_{fp,cp} arrays are
currently static, but they could be converted to dynamic allocation if necessary
at a point in future. Locking is deferred to the in-kernel user of bpf_mprog,
for example, in case of tcx which uses this API in the next patch, it piggy-
backs on rtnl. The nitty-gritty details are in the bpf_mprog_{replace,head_tail,
add,del} implementation and an extensive test suite for checking all aspects
of this API for prog-based attach/detach and link API as BPF selftests in
this series.

Kudos also to Andrii Nakryiko for API discussions wrt Meta's BPF management daemon.

Challenge 04: Karaoke song selector

Karaoke is a popular activity enjoyed by many people, where friends gather to sing songs for entertainment. In this challenge, I am working with a table called "songs" that stores information about various songs. My objective is to use SQL queries to decide what songs to sing based on specific criteria.

Step 1: Selecting All Song Titles
To begin, I executed a SELECT statement to retrieve all the song titles from the "songs" table. This step allows me to get a comprehensive list of available songs for our karaoke session.
SELECT title FROM songs;

Step 2: Selecting Epic or Recent Songs
In the second step, I added another SELECT statement that employs the OR operator. This query retrieves the titles of songs that have either an "epic" mood or a release date after 1990. The aim is to cater to the preferences of my friends who enjoy singing either recent songs or those with an epic feel.
SELECT title FROM songs WHERE mood = "epic" OR released > 1990;

Step 3: Selecting Epic, Recent, and Short Songs
As the night progresses, people often become more selective with their song choices. In this step, I enhanced my SELECT query using the AND operator. The query retrieves the titles of songs that have an "epic" mood, were released after 1990, and have a duration of less than 4 minutes. This criteria helps us narrow down the options to epic, recent, and shorter songs.
SELECT title FROM songs WHERE mood = "epic" AND released > 1990 AND duration < 240;

By executing these queries and working with the "songs" table, I can effectively determine the songs to sing at the karaoke session. The queries allow me to select all songs, filter based on mood or release date, and further refine the selection by considering song duration. This way, I can curate a karaoke playlist that suits the preferences and mood of the gathering.

Mapgen fixes and speedups (ignore the branch name. I'm dumb) (#1637)

## About The Pull Request

Alters the structure of map/planet generation to squash some bugs and
improve performance.

Previously, planet maps were generated by placing the ruin first, and
THEN generating the turfs according to the map_generator datum. This has
been adjusted -- now, turfs are generated WITHOUT objects such as
mobs/flora, the ruin is placed, and THEN the objects are added (turfs
are "populated"). In conjunction with the addition of needed
AfterChange() calls to update the atmos adjacency of the generated
turfs, this ensures that planet atmos acts correctly surrounding ruins.

When deleting reservations (such as the deletion of planets after
undocking), all objects on the planet are rounded up in a list and
qdeleted. Although this causes a small lag spike, it SHOULD prevent
items from hanging out inside the edges of planets.

There's a feature to change the default baseturf of a virtual level,
ZTRAIT_BASETURF, that we now use. This should cut down on the instances
where a ruin on a planet is blown up and there's space underneath (might
still happen on asteroids, because the baseturf there is still space; I
didn't want space turfs without space as their baseturf).

Overmap encounter areas aren't global anymore (they no longer have the
flag UNIQUE_AREA). Don't fucking add the flag UNIQUE_AREA to anything
that should have weather in it, because if that area gets added anywhere
else that _actually respects the flag_ you'll end up with cross-planet
weather, because weather code sucks. This didn't cause bugs before,
because the flag wasn't respected; it will now.

The biome assoc list has been moved into the map generator datum, and
all encounters now generate using a map generator that either uses a
biome or replaces everything with a single turf. This prevents
duplication of cave generation code and makes dynamic overmap object
code slightly easier to understand.

Some systems have been altered to improve performance; many of these
changes are rather small, like the changes to turf population (mob
placement now uses a stack of recently-created mobs to check if there
are any nearby, instead of checking everything within 12 turfs; I've yet
to add ruin mobs to these stacks to avoid placing mobs near ruin mobs)
or lighting objects (removed a single line that changed the color of the
lighting object on init).

Starlight has been altered, so that small turf changes near space turfs
don't need to check as many nearby turfs and so that large turf changes
can be batched to prevent further recalculation. This is probably
responsible for the biggest performance increase.

Smoothing groups are cached before sorting instead of after, to prevent
sort calls on many atom inits; /tg/station uses a unit test to avoid
needing to sort at runtime ever, but I couldn't figure out how to do
that without larger changes or writing a unit test that attempted to
instance every atom once, which would be an undertaking of its own.

Gas strings have been similarly altered, and now their interpretation
defaults to copying from a cached, immutable version of the mix encoded
by the string. This avoids the significant overhead caused by repeated
calls to params2list(). Auxmos has a better solution to this,
__auxtools_parse_gas_string(), but our current custom build of Auxmos
doesn't support it.

There are a few other small changes that I'm probably forgetting about
and you should yell at me to read my own fucking code and tell you what
else I changed.

- [ ] I affirm that I have tested all of my proposed changes and that
any issues found during tested have been addressed.

I still need to manually check each planet type to make sure they aren't
fucked up, I should probably do some proper profiling comparisons.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Fewer weird bugs, things generate faster, better* code.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Ruins don't sometimes start in hard vacuum anymore; planet turfs
now share atmos correctly.
fix: There hopefully shouldn't be any random stray objects sitting in
the edges of planets anymore.
fix: Planets now (hopefully) have the correct baseturfs (more or less).
When you bomb a ruin on a planet, it probably won't break through to
space anymore.
refactor: Planet generation has been refactored, improving performance
somewhat.

[Needs TM] The Accelerataning (#1781)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Gone are the days of spam clicking buttons to move faster in a
direction, with this PR, ships now accelerate constantly (as long as you
have fuel and don't touch the throttle) in a direction you set, leading
to a much smoother flight experience. I imagine it's going to be a bit
tougher to thread gaps, but flying a spaceship *is* quite literally
rocket science. So.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29362068/220281305-12f6b796-9d8a-41ce-84a6-236bb03274da.gif)

Also actually makes the minimum and maximum speed work, and adjusts them
to a more tolerable level.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Eliminates the ability to cheese high speeds by spamming the accelerate
button, and also makes the flight experience much more pleasant as you
don't have to spam click to move a decent speed.

## Changelog

:cl:
add: A new system for ship flight, where you only point a direction and
set the throttle to change your speed, reducing the need for
spam-clicking.
fix: There's now a maximum and minimum speed, 600spm and 0.01spm,
respectively. The limits have been broken all this time.

Add logic grid puzzle eval (#830)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
`logic-grid`

### Eval description

The model is prompted with a logic grid word problem with a list of
hints, categories, and values for the category. The model is then asked
to provide a solution, showing reasoning, in a set of Python tuples that
show the matched category values.

<details>
  <summary>See human-friendly example prompt</summary>

```
Using the hints and information provided, solve the following logic grid puzzle.
Show your reasoning concisely, but step-by-step, to arrive at your final answer.
Remember, since this is a grid-based puzzle, each option in every category will be used exactly once.
Since there are 4 values per category, and 3 categories, your final answer will include 4 tuples each of length 3.
 Puzzle Scenario:
A number of new space probes were launched this year. Using only the clues that follow, match each probe to the month it launched and its eventual destination.

Category Options:
  Probes: "Nalini", "Hikaru", "Sarika", and "Sven"
  Destinations: "Ganymede", "Titan", "Enceladus", and "Phobos"
  Months: "January", "February", "March", and "April"

Hints:
  1: The Hikaru launched 2 months before the Nalini.
  2: The probe going to Phobos launched sometime after the Hikaru.
  3: The Sven launched 2 months before the mission going to Ganymede.
  4: Of the probe that launched in April and the mission going to Titan, one is the Sarika and the other is the Nalini.

In your response, format your final answer for each set of linked category values as a python tuple of strings in this order:
("Enceladus", [value from months], [value from probes])
("Ganymede", [value from months], [value from probes])
("Phobos", [value from months], [value from probes])
("Titan", [value from months], [value from probes])
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>See expected/ideal answer</summary>

```
("Enceladus", "January", "Hikaru")
("Ganymede", "April", "Sarika")
("Phobos", "February", "Sven")
("Titan", "March", "Nalini")
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>See failure case from GPT-4 (at least from the web UI - I don't
have API access to GPT-4)</summary>

```
Step 1: From Hint 3, we know that Hikaru launched 2 months before Nalini. Since the latest month available is April, this means that Nalini cannot have launched in April because there wouldn't be a 2-month gap for Hikaru. So, Nalini must be the probe going to Titan (from Hint 4), and Sarika must be the probe that launched in April.

Step 2: Since Nalini is going to Titan, from Hint 4, it must have launched in February to allow Hikaru to launch in December (2 months before). However, December is not an option, so Hikaru must have launched in January (the earliest month possible) and Nalini in March.

Step 3: The Sven launched 2 months before the mission going to Ganymede (Hint 2). Since Sven cannot be launched in January (as Hikaru is launched in January), it must have launched in February. That means the mission to Ganymede must be in April.

Step 4: The only remaining month is March, and the only remaining probe is Nalini. So Nalini was launched in March.

Step 5: The probe going to Phobos launched sometime after Hikaru (Hint 1). Since Hikaru launched in January, the only remaining option for Phobos is Sarika, which launched in April.

Step 6: The only remaining destination is Enceladus, and the only remaining probe is Hikaru, so Hikaru is going to Enceladus.

The final answer is:
("Enceladus", "January", "Hikaru")
("Ganymede", "April", "Sven")
("Phobos", "April", "Sarika")
("Titan", "March", "Nalini")
```
</details>

### What makes this a useful eval?

This set of evals relies on a lot of *context-ramping* (as I call it)
for LLMs to get right - relying on chain-of-thought style logic to
'ramp' into the most likely next-deduction for a multi-parameter logical
problem.
These prompts are written as word problems and don't rely on any ASCII
or markdown type of table to express the puzzle (though `gpt-3.5-turbo`
appears to use markdown tables in it's chain of thought).

This ramping gets expensive and doesn't scale well with the increase of
category or values-per-category parameters, and is something that LLMs
might benefit from avoiding (either by requiring less of a context-ramp
to get to the meat of an answer, or by the surrounding
infrastructure/problem agent that tries to use a cheaper ensemble for
most of the context ramping, or other strategies).

The reasoning skills required for this kind of <b>constraint
satisfaction</b> expressed in natural language word prompts can, in
theory, generalize to solving constraints expressed in less structured
formats in the wild.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [X] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [X] <span title="A GPT-4 failure case from the eval set is included
above.">Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either
GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.</span>
- [X] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [X] **<span title="15 examples per grid size are included, for 6
different grid sizes, make a total of 90 included examples.">Include at
least 15 high quality examples.</span>**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This eval contains varied prompts and grid sizes, 15 examples per grid
size, for a total of 90 procedurally generated puzzles.
~This PR also implements (disabled by default) multiline answers and
punctuation whitelisting behavior in `FuzzyMatch`, which was required
due to the structural nature of the logic grid answers and the behavior
of `utils.normalize(...)` which (prior to this PR) did not provide any
functionality to interpret answers that span across newline characters
`\n` or preserve punctuation where it may be useful (in this case, the
model is prompted for the resultant grid associations in python tuple
format, so the punctuation in `(",)` is configured to be preserved for
these evals).
The new functionality is, again, disabled by default, such that existing
evals are not affected.~

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [X] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [X] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [X] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [X] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [X] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [X] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [X] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [X] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

[Eval] English-Russian homonym context resolution (GPT-3.5: 0.42) (#1064)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, pelase note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
English-Russian homonym context resolution

### Eval description

Cross-lingual English-Russian eval to resolve ambiguity with homonyms
present.

### What makes this a useful eval?

[Insert why this eval is worth including and any additional context]
Cross-lingual homonyms are hard to resolve: they add context ambiguity,
which needs to be resolved via reasoning.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
> german-part-of-speech

### Eval description

> For a given German word, the model is asked to list all possible parts
of speech (multiple choice). The model is also asked to think about the
word as an inflection of another word. The models output is tested
against annotations extracted from de.wiktionary.org. This is a follow
up to #1039

### What makes this a useful eval?

> Part of speech analysis is a basic task in language / grammar classes.
While it is usually done in the context of a sentence, coming up with
possible uses in lack of a sentence requires a certain amount of
creativity and language understanding, or very good recall of
information that is usually sparse outside of dictionaries. The task in
this eval could be seen as a combination of part of speech analysis and
an easy-to-evaluate form of the question "How could x be used in a
sentence".

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good

- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> To build the dataset, all 1.000.000+ entries of the German wiktionary
were parsed. Excluded from this list were all phrases, abbreviations,
symbols, names, toponyms and any words with at least one possible part
of speech not fitting the categories given in the prompt. Also I had to
exclude some entries where the part of speech could not be determined
automatically from the wikitext.
> From this set, words were sampled so that each combination of the
parts of speech existing in the dataset would be equally likely in the
tests. This way the model is tested to respond with all possible uses of
a word and not just the most common ones. > For combinations that fit a
lot of words, the uniform sampling led to a bias towards rarely used
words.
> The labels of each word were taken from the corresponding page at
de.wiktionary.org/wiki/{word}. The information taken from each page was:
the word, the part of speech this word can have in German and whether
the word is an abbreviation or not.
> This means only factual data was taken and is therefore in the public
domain.

Merge #99191

99191: rpc: retain information about failed connections r=aliher1911 a=tbg

Prior to this change, `rpc.Context` did not remember a connection after it
failed. A connection attempt would be created whenever we didn't have a
functioning connection to the given `(nodeID, targetAddress, class)` and
callers would be multiplexed onto it as long as that attempt was not known to
have failed.

The main problem with this setup was that it makes it difficult to provide good
observability because a remote node that just hasn't been dialed yet and one
that is down but between attempts looks the same. We could write code that
periodically tries to fully connect all nodes in the cluster to each other, but
even then exporting good metrics is challenging and while we're currently
comfortable with a densely connected cluster, that may change over time.

An additional challenge was presented by circuit breaking and logging of
attempts. Without state retained, we were limited to a simple retry scheme with
lots of redundant logging. It wasn't easy to log how long a connection had been
unhealthy (as an unhealthy connection was represented as an absent connection),
so in effect folks had to trawl through logs to grab the corresponding
timestamps of first and last failure.

Another piece of complexity were the RPC circuit breakers. These were
implemented at the NodeDialer-level (i.e. one circuit breaker per
`(NodeID,Class`)) but kept in the `rpc.Context` (which generally operates on
`(NodeID, Addr, Class)` because gossip also used them. The library they were
using uses recruitment of client traffic, which also isn't ideal as it could
periodically subject a SQL query to a timeout failure. We'd really prefer it
if the breakers probed without user traffic recruitment.

This PR addresses the above shortcomings:

- state is now retained across restarts on a `(NodeID, Addr, Class)` basis in
  the `rpc.Context. This has a few complications, for example we need to handle
decommissioned nodes, as well as nodes that restart under a new listening
address.
- the NodeDialer-level circuit breakers are removed.
- we're no longer recruiting user traffic for probes. Instead, we adopt the
  `util/circuit` package already used for Replica-level circuit breaking. This
library uses an async background probe to determine when to heal the breaker.

I also think the amount of incidental complexity in the `rpc` package is greatly
reduced as a result of this work.

I ran the `failover/non-system/` suite of tests to validate this change. The results
look good[^res].

Epic: CRDB-21710
Release note (ui change): a "Networking" metrics dashboard was added.
Release note (ops change): CockroachDB now exposes the following metrics:
- `rpc.connection.{un,}healthy`: Gauge of healthy/unhealthy connections,
- `rpc.connection.{un,}healthy_nanos`: Gauge of aggregate duration the currently {un,}healthy connections have been {,un}healthy for,
-  `grpc.connection.avg_round_trip_latency`: sum of weighted moving averages of round-trip latencies for all peers (it really only makes sense to consume these on a per-peer basis via prometheus)
- Counters `rpc.connection.heartbeats` and `rpc.connection.failures`.
When the `server.child_metrics.enabled` cluster setting is set, these metrics export per-peer values, meaning they can be used to derive a connectivity graph.
Release note (ops change): logging for intra-node RPC connection failures has improved by reducing frequently and improving information content.

In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood, burned by the embers of Armageddon, his soul blistered by the fires of hell and tainted beyond ascension. He chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace, and with boiling blood he scoured the umbral plans seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the knight sentinels, and those who tasted the bite of his sword name him the Doomslayer.

Fix rowcount estimate for SubqueryScan that's under a Gather.

SubqueryScan was always getting labeled with a rowcount estimate
appropriate for non-parallel cases.  However, nodes that are
underneath a Gather should be treated as processing only one
worker's share of the rows, whether the particular node is explicitly
parallel-aware or not.  Most non-scan-level node types get this
right automatically because they base their rowcount estimate on
that of their input sub-Path(s).  But SubqueryScan didn't do that,
instead using the whole-relation rowcount estimate as if it were
a non-parallel-aware scan node.  If there is a parallel-aware node
below the SubqueryScan, this is wrong, and it results in inflating
the cost estimates for nodes above the SubqueryScan, which can cause
us to not choose a parallel plan, or choose a silly one --- as indeed
is visible in the one regression test whose results change with this
patch.  (Although that plan tree appears to contain no SubqueryScans,
there were some in it before setrefs.c deleted them.)

To fix, use path->subpath->rows not baserel->tuples as the number
of input tuples we'll process.  This requires estimating the quals'
selectivity afresh, which is slightly annoying; but it shouldn't
really add much cost thanks to the caching done in RestrictInfo.

This is pretty clearly a bug fix, but I'll refrain from back-patching
as people might not appreciate plan choices changing in stable branches.
The fact that it took us this long to identify the bug suggests that
it's not a major problem.

Per report from bucoo, though this is not his proposed patch.

Manually hide our DesktopWindowXamlSource (#15165)

As discussed in #6507

Newer builds of Windows do this automatically. However, this was spotted
in the wild on 1.18. It's possible the threading changes created a
situation where the OS-side fix no longer applied to us. So let's just
do it manually. It doesn't have any side effects.

I saw this once on Win11, but couldn't repro it this morning when I
tried to add this fix. I'm just gonna assume this worked, despite the
fact that I can't repro it on win11 anymore.

closes #6507

See also #14957

## detailed description

> `WindowsXamlManager::XamlCore::Initialize` calls
`ConfigureCoreWindow`, which creates a `CoreWindow` on the thread

> Problem is, we're calling that on the main thread (which doesn't have
_any_ windows), and then eventually creating a `DesktopWindowXamlSource`
on a second thread for the actual window

> It's not that it "manages a window", it's that it "manages xaml on
Windows OS". just use ICoreWindowInterop -- QI for ICoreWindowInterop
and call get_WindowHandle.

feat: persistent bind-mounts

This is an important change, where we get remove the previous `--mount`
option, and instead opt for persistent bind-mounts.

Persistent bind mounts have several advantages:
- They make it easier to remember which folders need to be bind-mounted.
- Code is *much* less clunky, as we no longer need to generate temporary
  docker-compose files.
- They allow us to bind-mount host directories *at build time* using the
  buildx `--build-context` option.
- The transition from development to production becomes much easier, as
  images will automatically be built using the host repo.

The only drawback is that persistent bind-mounts are slightly less
portable: when a config.yml file is moved to a different folder, many
things will break if the repo is not checked out in the same path.

For instance, this is how to start working on a local fork of
edx-platform:

    tutor config save --append MOUNTS=/path/to/edx-platform

And that's all there is to it. No, this fork will be used whenever we
run:

    tutor images build openedx
    tutor local start
    tutor dev start

This change is made possible by huge improvements in the build time
performance. These improvements make it convenient to re-build Docker
images often.

Update README.md

Data Used

Data - HR Data with over 22000 rows from the year 2000 to 2020.

Data Cleaning & Analysis - MySQL, Jupyter Notebook(sql magic)

Data Visualization - PowerBI
Questions

    What is the gender breakdown of employees in the company?
    What is the race/ethnicity breakdown of employees in the company?
    What is the age distribution of employees in the company?
    How many employees work at headquarters versus remote locations?
    What is the average length of employment for employees who have been terminated?
    How does the gender distribution vary across departments and job titles?
    What is the distribution of job titles across the company?
    Which department has the highest turnover rate?
    What is the distribution of employees across locations by state?
    How has the company's employee count changed over time based on hire and term dates?
    What is the tenure distribution for each department?

Summary of Findings

    There are more male employees
    White race is the most dominant while Native Hawaiian and American Indian are the least dominant.
    The youngest employee is 20 years old and the oldest is 57 years old
    5 age groups were created (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64). A large number of employees were between 25-34 followed by 35-44 while the smallest group was 55-64.
    A large number of employees work at the headquarters versus remotely.
    The average length of employment for terminated employees is around 7 years.
    The gender distribution across departments is fairly balanced but there are generally more male than female employees.
    The Marketing department has the highest turnover rate followed by Training. The least turn over rate are in the Research and development, Support and Legal departments.
    A large number of employees come from the state of Ohio.
    The net change in employees has increased over the years.
    The average tenure for each department is about 8 years with Legal and Auditing having the highest and Services, Sales and Marketing having the lowest.

Limitations

    Some records had negative ages and these were excluded during querying(967 records). Ages used were 18 years and above.
    Some termdates were far into the future and were not included in the analysis(1599 records). The only term dates used were those less than or equal to the current date.

Fix Pack 3: Revenge Of The Fuck (#225)

* Various Jaunt fixes (#70431)

* Jaunt code path reworked so that traits and other effects can be removed consistently regardless of how effect is ended.
Jaunts will more consistently clean themselves up (and unjaunt you) when you lose the spell.
If a shuttle lands on you while you are jaunted it will now kill you instead of crashing and fucking with the shuttle landing process.
Z travelling while inside an object or mob will now relay that direction instead, allowing you to jaunt up and down as well as cardinally.
Mirror walk button updates at correct times.
Blood and Shadow walk buttons have same functionality as Mirror Walk.

* Fixes Soul Scythe being able to get to Centcom by moving down on the bottom Z-level (#71171)

## About The Pull Request

`/obj/item/soulscythe/relaymove()` was using `get_step()` which doesn't
understand our multi-z system and was happily trying to move Z - 1 which
is Centcom. I'm still not really sure I understand why move() allowed
the scythe to just move right through the floor in this case, I think
moving to turfs with `density = 0` is also behaving strangely and just
skipping some checks that should keep it from moving through the floor,
but to be honest I don't fully understand the move chain and just
changing to `get_step_multiz()` at least keeps the scythe from going to
Z-levels it shouldn't.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Whilst it is fun for the scythe to go on an adventure to forbidden
Z-levels, admins probably don't appreciate these adventures so much.
## Changelog

fix: Soul Scythes can no longer phase through the floor into Centcom.

## About The Pull Request

We log this information once, on SSgarbage shutdown. Putting it in a
json is kinda pointless, it exists to be read when we see massive
overtime from ssgarbage, that's all.

Something something reee my workflow.

the otherwise typical json logging system

* Converts del logging to proper json, using json objects instead of building a text file (#75636)

## About The Pull Request

It's easier to parse, and makes more sense when you read it. This way
I'll never have to add yet another case to my parser for someone
changing where a space goes or something.

Moves qdel into its own category cause the old name looked ugly (yell if
this is dumb)

enables pretty printing json lists.

[Eval] An array of Liar Paradox-based evals (#883)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
logic-liar-paradox

### Eval description

An array of Liar Paradox-based evals, examining the model's proficiency
in navigating linguistic nuances and logical reasoning within
self-referential statements.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This eval is particularly useful because it delves into complex, nuanced
logical concepts and self-referential statements, which have
historically posed challenges for AI models. By exploring various
contexts, alternative logical frameworks, and modifications to
statements, this eval helps assess the model's ability to adapt to
different perspectives, grasp subtleties in language, and engage in
flexible reasoning. The ability to understand and navigate paradoxes is
an essential aspect of human-like reasoning, and improving an AI model's
performance in this area would significantly enhance its overall
usefulness and reliability in real-world applications. Additionally,
showcasing the model's improved proficiency in handling paradoxes would
not only make for a compelling marketing angle (as paradoxes are
understood by a much broader range of people than other difficult tasks
such as pure maths or quantum mechanics) but it would also demonstrate
the progress made in AI's capacity to think and reason more like humans.
It also adds paradox-absorbing crumple zones.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

- [x] Addresses complex logical reasoning: The eval focuses on AI's
ability to comprehend and navigate paradoxes, self-referential
statements, and context switching, which are important aspects of
human-like reasoning. By testing the model's proficiency in these areas,
we can identify areas for improvement and work towards enhancing AI's
overall capacity to think and reason more like humans.
- [x] Demonstrates adaptability and flexibility: The eval showcases the
model's ability to switch between contexts, alter premises, and engage
with different dimensions of inferred logic. This will help assess the
model's adaptability and flexibility in diverse real-world situations,
making it more reliable and useful.
- [x] Contributes to AI safety and understanding: By identifying the
model's weaknesses and limitations in handling paradoxes and complex
logical constructs, the eval can contribute to AI safety and enable
researchers to better understand the challenges faced by large language
models in these areas.
- [x] Engaging and appealing: An eval that delves into paradoxes and
complex thought exercises is not only intellectually stimulating but
also adds an appealing element to showcase the model's capabilities,
making it more attractive for both researchers and end-users.

### Unique eval value

- [x] Encourages creativity and lateral thinking: The eval, by focusing
on paradoxes and complex logical constructs, encourages both the AI and
its developers to think creatively and approach problem-solving from
unconventional angles. This can lead to the discovery of novel solutions
and a better understanding of the model's capabilities.
- [x] Aligns with human values and expectations: An AI that can
successfully navigate paradoxes and complex logic is more likely to
align with human values and expectations. By addressing these challenges
in the eval, we strive to develop AI systems that understand and respect
the nuances of human thought and communication.
- [x] Addresses a broad range of applications: Improved reasoning and
context-switching abilities can have a significant impact on various AI
applications, including natural language understanding, decision-making,
and problem-solving in domains such as law, philosophy, ethics, and
more.
- [x] Fosters interdisciplinary collaboration: The exploration of
paradoxes and complex logic often draws upon insights from multiple
disciplines, including philosophy, linguistics, psychology, and computer
science. This eval can help foster interdisciplinary collaboration,
leading to richer and more diverse perspectives on AI development and
its potential impact on society.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

its truth. If the statement is false, then it is not the case that it is

Add SVG understanding eval (#786)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
`svg_understanding`

### Eval description

The model is provided with the contents of an SVG path (anywhere from
~1000 to ~8000 characters) of a simple object (eg `frog`, `banana`) and
is asked to provide the label.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This is a test of visual understanding and mental modeling. A motivated
human could succeed on these evals with enough time and a piece of graph
paper: in theory, a sufficiently advanced LLM could have the in-context
capacity to do this on the fly.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This uniquely tests the ability to incrementally build visual models:
eg, the ability of the LLM to both "draw" and visualize that "drawing".

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

The Ultimate Guide to Shipping Cargo from Dubai to Pakistan

Are you planning to ship cargo from Dubai to Pakistan? Whether it's for personal or business reasons, shipping your belongings or products can be a daunting task. But fear not, as we have compiled the ultimate guide to help you navigate through the process. From understanding the benefits of shipping cargo from Dubai to Pakistan, to overcoming challenges that may arise along the way, this comprehensive guide has got you covered. So sit back and read on to learn everything you need to know about shipping cargo from Dubai to Pakistan!

What is the process of shipping cargo from Dubai to Pakistan?

The process of shipping cargo from Dubai to Pakistan generally involves several stages, such as packing, documentation, transportation and delivery. Firstly, you will need to pack your items carefully in order to ensure their safe transport. You can choose between different packaging options depending on the type of goods you are shipping.

Next, you will need to prepare all the necessary documentation for customs clearance purposes. This includes bills of lading, commercial invoices, packing lists and certificates of origin. It's important that you have all these documents ready before shipment to avoid any delays or penalties.

Afterwards, your cargo will be transported by either air or sea freight depending on your budget and delivery time requirements. The transportation stage is where most issues may arise during shipping due to unexpected weather conditions or other logistical challenges.

Once your cargo has arrived at its destination port in Pakistan, it will undergo customs clearance procedures before being delivered to its final destination. This typically involves inspections and payment of import duties if applicable.

The process of shipping cargo from Dubai to Pakistan requires careful planning and execution in order for everything to run smoothly without any hiccups along the way.

What are the benefits of shipping cargo from Dubai to Pakistan?

Shipping cargo from Dubai to Pakistan provides several benefits, making it a popular choice for businesses and individuals alike. Firstly, Dubai is strategically located between Europe and Asia, serving as an ideal hub for global trade. This means that shipping cargo from this city can help save time and money on transportation costs.

Moreover, the UAE has established itself as a major player in the logistics industry due to its state-of-the-art infrastructure facilities such as ports, airports, highways and railways. This enables faster movement of goods while ensuring their safety throughout the journey.

Another key benefit of shipping cargo from Dubai to Pakistan is access to a wide range of products at competitive prices. With numerous free zones across Dubai specializing in various industries like electronics, textiles and food processing among others offering tax exemptions on imports and exports; businesses can source materials at lower rates than elsewhere.

Furthermore, with the rise of e-commerce in recent years more companies are now able to sell directly online which also opens up new avenues for growth opportunities when it comes to international trade via eCommerce platforms provided by leading players like Amazon or Alibaba Group's AliExpress platform -- providing greater reach internationally without needing physical locations outside one's home country!

What are the challenges of shipping cargo from Dubai to Pakistan?

Shipping cargo from Dubai to Pakistan can be a challenging process due to various reasons. The first and foremost challenge is the distance between the two countries, which involves crossing borders and dealing with customs regulations. This can lead to delays in clearance and additional charges.

Another challenge of shipping cargo from Dubai to Pakistan is the lack of infrastructure in certain parts of Pakistan, leading to difficulties in transportation and delivery. Poor road conditions, limited access to ports, and inadequate storage facilities are some of the obstacles that shippers may face.

Additionally, security concerns must be considered when shipping cargo from Dubai to Pakistan. The threat of theft or damage during transit is always present, especially for high-value items such as electronics or luxury goods.

Language barriers and cultural differences can pose challenges during communication with local port authorities or freight forwarding companies.

Despite these challenges, there are solutions available for businesses looking to ship cargo from Dubai to Pakistan. By working with experienced logistics providers who have extensive knowledge of local regulations and conditions, shippers can ensure smooth operations throughout the entire supply chain process.

How to overcome the challenges of shipping cargo from Dubai to Pakistan?

Shipping cargo from Dubai to Pakistan can come with its challenges, but there are ways to overcome these obstacles. One of the main challenges is navigating through the customs process. This requires compliance with regulations and paperwork that can often be time-consuming and complex.

To overcome this challenge, it's recommended to work with a reliable freight forwarding company that has experience in handling shipments between Dubai and Pakistan. They will have knowledge of customs requirements and will ensure all necessary documentation is prepared accurately, avoiding any delays or additional costs.

maint: drop support for Ruby < 2.5 and Rails < 5.0 (#227)

## Which problem is this PR solving?

- Fixes #224
- Closes #226 - supersedes these changes opt for simplifying Beeline
support in its maintenance/sunsetting days

Old, unmaintained versions of things are starting to make the CI matrix
of old combinations creak as the Ruby ecosystem starts to firmly drop
support for those old, unmaintained versions.

* [Ruby 2.4 was end-of-life'd](https://endoflife.date/ruby) 3 years ago
(Mar 2020).
* [Rails 4.2 was end-of-life'd](https://endoflife.date/rails) 6 years
ago (Apr 2017)

## Short description of the changes

- Removes Ruby < 2.5 and Rails < 5.0 from the CI matrix
- Remove examples/rails41
- Change the beeline's required_ruby_version from ">= 2.2.0" to ">=
2.5.0"
- Appease Rubocop violations for new TargetRubyVersion of 2.5

## Some Notes About Appeasement

* appease Rubocop: Style/SafeNavigation
    
    > Use safe navigation (&.) instead of checking if an object exists before calling the method.
    
    Personally, I don't like how safe-nav reads, but my Ruby tastes were
    established a long time ago. I won't fight the cop on this one.

* appease Rubocop: Style/UnpackFirst
    
    > Use digest.unpack1("I!>") instead of digest.unpack("I!>").first
    
    "‘String#unpack` can be replaced with the shorter method `unpack1`."
    I'm just accepting this one. "Shorter" must mean the code *you* write
    --for example, x.unpack("hey").first--because "unpack" on its own is 6
    characters and "unpack1" is 7. :D

* appease Rubocop: Performance/RegexpMatch
    
    > Use match? instead of =~ when MatchData is not used.
    
    'match?' predicate methods introduced in Ruby 2.4 are faster than match
    (which is called by =~) by avoiding the creation of a MatchData object
    and not tracking backref.

* appease Rubocop: Style/RedundantFreeze
    
    > Do not freeze immutable objects, as freezing them has no effect.
    
    Sure. Note the frozen_string_literal declaration at the top of these
    files.

* appease Rubocop: Layout/EmptyLinesAroundBlockBody
    
    > Extra empty line detected at block body end.
    
    Removed.

* appease Rubocop: Layout/IndentationWidth
    
    > Use 2 (not 4) spaces for indentation.
    
    Sure. Yeah.

* appease Rubocop: Style/RedundantBegin
    
    > Redundant begin block detected.
    
    Yup. do..end blocks have an implicit 'begin' and rescue works fine
    within them.

Update base for Update on "(WIP; DO NOT REVIEW) Use python tensor subclass version of NT for PT2"


I'm out next week so I'm dumping some stuff here for whoever is interested. Added some notes inline. Other things:
* Main idea: convert real NT -> fake / meta instance of `NestedTensor` python tensor subclass during tracing and use that throughout the rest of the PT2 stack
* Python tensor subclass only supports contiguous for now
    * Only need `sizes` because of this, and `sizes` is a dim-length list containing int / List[int] items (for ragged dims) OR SymInts for dynamic shapes (will probably only support this case anyway)
* Inference-only for now; ignore Autograd
* Skip functionalization on NTs for now (there's no in-place op support anyway, although we should ideally handle NT <-> T views within functionalization)

Example script:
```python
import torch
from torch.nested import nested_tensor
from torch.nested._nested_tensor import NestedTensor
from torch._inductor import debug

torch._inductor.config.debug = True
torch._dynamo.config.traceable_tensor_subclasses.add(NestedTensor)

device = 'cuda'

def make_tensor(*shape, device=device, dtype=torch.float32):
    return torch.randn(*shape, device=device, dtype=dtype)

torch.manual_seed(1)

def fn(x, x_offsets):
    x_nt = torch._nested_view_from_jagged(x, x_offsets)
    x_nt = x_nt + 69
    x_nt = x_nt * 42
    return x_nt

torch._dynamo.disallow_in_graph(torch.diff)

compiled_fn = torch.compile(fn)

# shape (sum(*), D)
# component shapes: (3, 5), (4, 5), (6, 5)
x = make_tensor(13, 5)
x_offsets = torch.tensor([0, 3, 7, 13], dtype=torch.int64, device=device)

# helps create dynamic graph right away
torch._dynamo.mark_dynamic(x, 0)
torch._dynamo.mark_dynamic(x_offsets, 0)

output = compiled_fn(x, x_offsets)

# shape (sum(*), D)
# component shapes: (2, 5), (6, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5)
y = make_tensor(17, 5)
y_offsets = torch.tensor([0, 2, 8, 12, 17], dtype=torch.int64, device=device)

output2 = compiled_fn(y, y_offsets)

print(output)
print(output2)
```

WARNING: AWFUL HACKS AHEAD. DO NOT REVIEW YET.

Add files via upload

title: Sound Spherize

Artist’s Statement
I wanted to make a patch that contains an audiovisual work using objects that change in real time through sound

Technical Description
The patch is structured in two basic parts: audio and video.
Audio part is structured in the loading of external audio files and possibility of simultaneously acquiring audio from sources outside; sub-patch containing a random particle selector of the loaded sample was added to randomize sequence; possibility to calculate average bpm frequency by pressing the space key several times; sonogram object has been added to monitor incoming frequencies.
Video part is structured in external window that can be moved into another monitor for the fullscreen while working on parameters of the patch; it contains various graphic elements, including the sphere which modulates raised texture generated by bfg object and density by the width of the incoming volume and synchronized with calculated bpm; below a equalizer generated by multislider that reacts to the alpha channel of bfg object; spherical context was created where a 360 image was applied.
Parameters that can be modified in real time are: change of alpha textures for object jit.bfg, materials of the sphere, type of rendering of sphere, diameter amplitude, sphere intensity of bfg texture, external 360 image, rotation degrees of the ​​context and speed, switch auto rotation.
Patch contains various comments alongside the key points.

Audio Logic Part
we start from the "ezadc~" audio input from which we have the main input to the bfg texture modulation through the "convert signal" sub-patch whose output value directly modifies the "weight" parameter of the bfg object, the parameter "s color" and the scale of the bfg texture; the "sfplay~" object was added to have the ability to load external audio files directly into Max and change the frequency of specific fragments using the "randomize" sub-patch, and the "noise gen" sub-patch was added which contains a series of "cycle~", "tri~" and "kink~" signals, modulated in non-linear sequence; a selector for the space key has been added through which we can insert a specific "time" in the "clicker" sub-patch which allows us to synchronize in bpm ("synch" sub-patch) the bfg object and the audio fragment randomizer , every 5 seconds of inactivity the bpm average calculation timer is reset.

Video Logic Part
to the "jit.bfg" object was added the "jit.normalize" object to increase the white areas of the texture, then the "slide_up" and "slide_down" parameters was modified to react more smoothly to the change in audio frequency; the multislider is calculated using "jit.op" operators to translate the alpha channel of bfg into heights for the equalizer ("jit.gl.graph" x2 sub-patch); the sphere in "jit.gl.gridshape" considers the texture from bfg as a surface height map calculating the black as ground point and the white the maximum height point; inside the object jit.gen there are the parameters "swiz" to remake the components of the vectors, combining the texture with the amplitude of the audio signal (bfg + sub-patch "convert signal"); colors have been assigned to the equalizer which change according to the amount of incoming sound ("s color"), added two lights at the scene ("light" sub-patch), added a camera ("jit.gl.camera"), added a switch to rotate the environment 360 ("s spin") and a selector for materials (black and gray) of the sphere, angle of rotation ("s degrees") and speed of rotation ("s phase"), the loading of the external image 360 ​​takes place in the sub-patch "texture env", while the application to the sphere of context (the larger one) is in the "360" sub-patch, the rotation of each object is conducted by the "autorotate" sub-patch.

Credits
the "env.jpg" file of the 360 enviroment context can be found at "https://adastra.fit.edu/blog/uncategorized/astrophysics/" (reference in the patch).
the audio file "drm_loop02.wav" and the piano song in the demo video are owned by Flavio Severino.

Future Work
the idea of the sound reactive sphere was suggested by my own A/V work a few years ago: Wraithmachine (https://vimeo.com/208282868), implementing a more solid and better planned version thanks to your course, so I don't think I will develop this project further.

Self-assessment
Art / aesthetics of result
- Evaluation: real-time modeling fluidity of the sphere and implementation of a 360 context, the equalizer responds well to the bfg map
- Comparison to intention: the artistic production found is similar to what I had in mind at the time of departure, perhaps it is possible to increase the three-dimensional effect of the context 360

Max Programming
-Evaluation: the sound of the "randomize" function have a perfectly non-linear function, but do not move fragments in the time parameter (ms)
-Comparison to intention: I managed to create a patch that I hope will be clear and legible, even if not all the elements are classified in sub-patches, being able to create some confusion when reading the work area

Implementation of additional project elements
- Evaluation: limited choice of materials, (perhaps the possibility of choosing personal materials could be added)
- Comparison to intention: there are many parameters that can be changed manually to be able to customize the A/V experience, however it seems (especially for the audio part) that the "play/stop" and the transition to "randomize" remain a bit cumbersome

Modify KubernetesClient shutdown behaviour  (#24613) [5.3.z] (#24710)

Backport of: https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24613

The overall goal of this change is to change the shutdown behaviour of
KubernetesClient so our Stateful Set monitor thread shuts down before
our `ClusterTopologyIntentTracker`, to allow the intent tracker to fully
process all completed messages before Node shutdown.

**The Current Problem**
In its current state, the Stateful Set monitor thread is intended to
shutdown after `Thread#interrupt` is called, triggering the
`Thread#interrupted` check within the main `while(running)` loop of the
Runnable. However, this check is not reached as the call to
`WatchResponse#readLine` from within the main `run()` method is a
blocking call that waits until data is available to read before
proceeding. Since this call waits for non-null data before completing,
the result is always non-null, and therefore this code block never exits
under normal conditions:
```java
while ((message = watchResponse.nextLine()) != null) {
    onMessage(message);
}
```

Since this `while` loop cannot exit, and the `#readLine` method (which
passes to `BufferedReader#readLine` under the hood) is a blocking I/O
operation which cannot be interrupted, this operation does not end when
`Thread#interrupt` is called. This leads to the Stateful Set monitor
thread out-living the `ClusterTopologyIntentTracker`, even if the
StsMonitor is interrupted first. As a result, during shutdown, it is
possible for the StsMonitor to send data to the intent tracker after it
has been destroyed and its executor is no longer accepting tasks.

**The Root of the Problem**
To reach our goal of ensuring that the Stateful Set monitor thread can
no longer send requests to the `ClusterTopologyIntentTracker`, we need
to add synchronization between the two objects that guarantees the
intent tracker shuts down after the StsMonitor thread has completed.
This can be achieved using a simple `CountDownLatch` which is counted
down after the thread has completed, and awaited before shutting down
the tracker.

The main obstacle to achieving this is, as mentioned above, that the
StsMonitor thread cannot be interrupted when waiting for
`WatchResponse#readLine` to complete, and so the thread never completes.
The only way this thread can complete is to either force its
termination, or alter the message reading approach to allow interruption
as intended.

**Identifying Resolution Paths**
We don't want to force termination of our Stateful Set monitor thread as
this could result in message handling being terminated after it has been
received, but not before it has finished being processed. Therefore the
only way we can allow this thread to be interrupted as intended is to
alter the message reading mechanics in a way that allows it to be
interrupted as well.

There is no way for us to know if more messages are pending from the k8s
watch besides waiting for data to be received, so the best we can do is
allow the StsMonitor to finish processing any messages it has already
received (preventing process corruption), but terminate the stream of
new messages it is waiting for before we shutdown the intent tracker.

**Potential Solutions**
So we've identified the root of the problem as our `#readLine` function
blocking through interrupts, so how do we make it interruptible? Sadly
one of the shortcomings of I/O operations in Java is that they usually
cannot be interrupted in the traditional manner, so we have a few
approaches to consider:

1) We could modify the message reading code to use
`BufferedReader#ready` and `Thread#sleep` to periodically check if there
is data to be read before calling any read functions. The problem with
this approach is that A) `#ready` returns true if any data is available,
not just if there is a full line of data to be read; and B) utilizing a
sleep loop can result in delayed message handling at the least, or
busy-waiting overhead at worst.

2) We could use "hacky" solutions to interrupt the
`BufferedReader#readLine` such as closing underlying sockets or
connections, propagating an exception to the reader. The problem with
this solution is that everything related to our reading operation is
handled in `syncrhonized` blocks, and since our shutdown process starts
outside the StsMonitor thread, our calling thread is unable to obtain
these locks (being held by the StsMonitor)!

3) It's possible that we could rewrite the `WatchResponse` mechanics to
use Java NIO magic such as `Selector` for interruptible I/O operations.
The issue with this approach is that it would require fairly significant
refactoring of the related codebase, and may not end up providing the
exact functionality we are looking for in our use case.

4) We can introduce an `Executor` to handle our I/O operations within
the StsMonitor thread, allowing us to wait on a `Future#get` call
instead of our `BufferedReader#readLine` call, where a `Future#get`
operation can be interrupted by the waiting thread being interrupted.
The downside to this solution is we have to introduce an additional
thread on top of the existing StsMonitor thread itself.

**Selecting a Solution**
Considering the above information, I concluded the most sensible
approach was to use (4) and introduce an `Executor` thread for the I/O
operations. By using a separate thread for this call we can be rougher
with it, as we know that worse case scenario we interrupt a message
being read that has not started being processed yet (but we're shutting
down anyway).

This solution also allows for the least amount of underlying code
changes, as our `Future#get` can be interrupted without issue,
maintaining the current approach used for handling the StsMonitor
shutdown. The only downside for this approach is the addition of another
thread alongside the StsMonitor thread, but the actual impact of this
should be minimal as both threads will still be waiting most of the
time, so the only negative impact is being 1 tiny step closer to
possible thread starvation.

Generally I think this is the best solution at hand which allows quick
shutdown of the StsMonitor thread while minimising potential for data
loss or corruption. Combined with the `CountDownLatch` used, this allows
for consistent service shutdown order between the `StsMonitor` thread
and the `ClusterTopologyIntentTracker`.

Upgrade react-range to fix memory usage of sliders (#6764)

As mentioned in
https://blog.streamlit.io/six-tips-for-improving-your-streamlit-app-performance/
memory usage struggles in the browser if you have large ranges:

> Due to implementation details, high-cardinality sliders don't suffer
> from the serialization and network transfer delays mentioned earlier,
> but they will still lead to a poor user experience (who needs to
> specify house prices up to the dollar?) and high memory usage. In my
> testing, the example above increased RAM usage by gigabytes until the
> web browser eventually gave up (though this is something that should
> be solvable on our end. We'll look into it!)

This was caused by a bug in react-range, which I fixed last year.
https://github.com/tajo/react-range/pull/178

At the time, I had figured it would get picked up by a random yarn
upgrade and didn't worry too much about it.
But, apparently yarn doesn't really have an easy way of doing upgrades
of transitive dependencies (see https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/4986)?
I took the suggestion of someone in that thread to delete the entry and
let yarn regenerate it.

Some technical details about the react-range fix from the original
commit message (the "application" is a streamlit app):

> We have an application that uses react-range under the hood, and we
> noticed that a range input was taking 2GB of RAM on our machines. I
> did some investigation and found that regardless of whether the marks
> functionality was being used, refs were being created for each
> possible value of the range.

> We have some fairly huge ranges (we're using the input to scrub a
> video with potential microsecond accuracy), and can imagine that
> other people are affected by the previous behavior. This change
> should allow us to continue using large input ranges without
> incurring a memory penalty.

Makefile.lib: Lower kernel gzip compression to fastest

You're reading this - so you're trying to understand "JUST WHY OMG".
That's already a good step.

First of all, this is a downstream kernel - always keep that in mind!
Now, this kernel is targeting new *very powerful* Qualcomm platforms
like SM8250 and the Sony Edo platform - which has a very fast UFS card.

Keep in mind that the bootloader sets the CPU at a frequency that is
slightly faster than the "in the middle" ones, which is anyway not
veeeery fast - but that's good, really. I agree.

So.. check this out:   for Image.gz-dtb.....
COMP_LEVEL    SIZE
9             20116171
5	      20220479
2	      20940223
1	      21231290

Remember again that we're loading from a UFS card and that
we are loading ~1.1MB more out of a 20MB file.
If you're smart enough you surely know already about RAM and CPU
overhead of very high compression levels.

If you still disagree with what I just did, read this commit description
another 20 times, or more, until you understand it. :)))

I have the absolute hardest time understanding what is and isn't portable paths,
what does and doesn't make sense, extensions, basenames, parent paths, etc. etc.
(it doesn't help windows has like 4 different ways of defining an absolute path,
let alone relative paths).
Also, `brrpath` wasn't only path manipulation, I tried to do path stat'ing at
the same time, and somehow store the path-manipulation information with that
struct? It was very silly, to say the least.

Honestly, I think I'll come back to this later, maybe some kind of optional
caching system, each manipulation function is given an opaque pointer that
refers to precomputed information about the path (which isn't at all necessary,
btw).

Anyway, right now the only thing that remains is path stat'ing, moved to
`brrstat`, with a single simple struct, two simple enums, and a couple typedefs
for generalized file size and file position (as well as buffer size and buffer
position, both used in `brrfile`):

`brrbsize_t` = int:      Size of a file buffer, in bytes (limited to in relevant functions >= 256 bytes)
`brrbpos_t`  = int:      Byte-position within a buffer
`brrfsize_t` = uint64_t: Size of a file, in bytes (limited to INT64_MAX/2 bytes
                         for avoiding signed/unsignededness confusion, 4 EiB
                         should be enough, right?
`brrfpos_t`  = int64_t:  Byte-position within a file

`brrstat_ltype_t`: Path link type
	`none`: No linkage, path doesn't exist.
	`hard`: Given path is a hardlink (regular path).
	`soft`: Given path is a valid symlink; stat'ed information is about the
	        destination, not the link itself.
	`broken`: Given path is a broken symlink; stat'ed information is about the
	          link itself.
`brrstat_ftype_t`:
	`unknown`: An unknown type of path (socket, pipe, whatever weird crap
	           windows has).
	`file`: Path is a file.
	`directory`: Path is a directory
`brrstat_t`:
	`ltype`: Link type of path
	`ftype`: File type of path
	`size`: Size of the file, in bytes

Russian verse (#979)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, pelase note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
russian-verse

### Eval description

The most popular Russian poems that nearly every Russian speaker can
recall

### What makes this a useful eval?

Understanding a basic Russian poem or any foreign literature is
significant for a Language Learning Model (LLM) like GPT-4 because it
enhances multilingual ability, provides cultural context, and improves
understanding of language structure. It makes the model globally useful,
and culturally sensitive.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

context-free-grammar

### Eval description

This tests the ability for GPT-4 to evaluate whether or not a string can
be produced by a given context-free grammar.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This is an interesting computational task. Context-free languages are
important in linguistics, and it will be interesting to see
how a language model fares in handling this task.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some

eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)
I've handcrafted a lot of these examples. Some of them are there to
'trick' the model––I think it will be a useful test to see how well the
language model can do at those.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [✅] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [✅] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [✅] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)
