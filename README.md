[MIRROR] Nanotrasen basic mobs. [MDB IGNORE] (#24573)

* Nanotrasen basic mobs. (#78917)

## About The Pull Request

First and foremost, converts all Nanotrasen simplemobs into basic mobs.

To avoid messy and redundant code, or god forbid, making Nanotrasen mobs
a subtype of Syndicate ones, I've made Syndicate, Russian, and
Nanotrasen mobs all share a unified "Trooper" parent. This should have
no effect on their behaviors, but makes things much easier to extend
further in the future.

While most of this PR is pretty cut-and-dry, I've done a couple notable
things. For one, all types of ranged trooper will now avoid friendly
fire, instead of shooting their friends in the back. Even the Russians
have trigger discipline.

I've also created a new AI subtree that allows mobs to call for
reinforcements. I've hopefully made this easy to extend, but the
existing version works as follows:

- A mob with this subtree that gains a target that is also a mob will
call out to all mobs within 15 tiles.
- If they share a faction, mobs receiving the call will have the target
added to their retaliate list, and have a new key set targeting the
calling mob.
- If they have the correct subtree in their AI controller, called-to
mobs will then run over to help out.

Sadly, this behavior is currently used only by a few completely unused
Nanotrasen mobs, so in practice it will not yet be seen.

Finally, I've fixed a minor issue where melee Russian mobs punch people
to death despite holding a knife. They now use the proper effects for
stabbing instead of punching.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Removes 8 more simple animals from the list.

As said above, making all "trooper" type mobs share a common parent cuts
down on code reuse, ensures consistency of behavior, and makes it much
easier to add new troopers not affiliated with these groups. I expect
that I'll make pirates share this same parent next.

The new "reinforcements" behavior, though extremely powerful, opens up
exciting new opportunities in the future. There aren't many existing
behaviors that allow basic mobs to work _together_ in interesting ways,
and I think adding some enemy teamwork could be fun.
## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: Hostile Nanotrasen mobs now use the basic mob framework. This
should make them a little smarter and more dangerous. Please report any
bugs.
fix: Russian mobs will now actually use those knives they're holding.

Make CAN signal names unique (#1019)

### Summary
<!-- Quick summary of changes, optional -->

Currently CAN signal names are not unique. This is not a problem when
using PCAN or writing code, since signals are categorized by their CAN
message. However, this is not the case when uploading data to Influx,
since then only signal names are uploaded. This means that there are
weird conflicts between signals of the same name. For example, `State`
for the BMS and the DCM.

This PR changes so signal names are prefixed by their board, and then we
enforce all signals are unique across all boards. To avoid ridiculously
long CAN setters/getters in the firmware, only the signal name is now
used.

For example:
| | Before | After |

|-----------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Message | `BMS_Contactors` | `BMS_Contactors` |
| Signal | `AirPositive` | `BMS_AirPositive` |
| TX Setter | `App_CanTx_BMS_Contactors_AirPositive_Set` |
`App_CanTx_BMS_AirPositive_Set` |

The board name prefixes are also now added automatically to
messages/signals, so they've been removed from the `*_tx.json` files.

### Changelist 
<!-- Give a list of the changes covered in this PR. This will help both
you and the reviewer keep this PR within scope. -->

- Change `jsoncan` Python to support these changes
- Rename all signals
- Removed a few unused signals

Note: This diff is huge because of the autogenerated example code in
`jsoncan`. I should really remove this and add proper unit tests
instead.

### Testing Done
<!-- Outline the testing that was done to demonstrate the changes are
solid. This could be unit tests, integration tests, testing on the car,
etc. Include relevant code snippets, screenshots, etc as needed. -->

- [x] Validated on car

### Resolved Issues
<!-- Link any issues that this PR resolved like so: `Resolves #1, #2,
and #5` (Note: Using this format, Github will automatically close the
issue(s) when this PR is merged in). -->

### Checklist
*Please change `[ ]` to `[x]` when you are ready.*
- [x] I have read and followed the code conventions detailed in
[README.md](../README.md) (*This will save time for both you and the
reviewer!*).
- [x] If this pull request is longer then **500** lines, I have provided
*explicit* justification in the summary above explaining why I *cannot*
break this up into multiple pull requests (*Small PR's are faster and
less painful for everyone involved!*).

Shapechange health transfer tweaks (#79009)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #78721
This PR does a handful of things behind the scenes to increase the
consistency of shapechange health tracking.

First of all we adjust the order of operations taken when you restore
the original body. The implementation as-was would remove the status
effect midway through and null a bunch of variables we tried to continue
using. This would result in several runtimes and code failing to run,
with the upshot that untransforming upon death would leave the caster
completely alive, with the corpse of its transformed shape at its feet.
Oops.

Additionally while testing this I realised that transferring the damagew
as also kind of fucked.
We wouldn't bother to do it at _all_ if you died, which is a shame, so I
made it simply heal you instead of reviving you so we can always do it.
Then as noted in the linked issue, we were applying all transferred
damage to a single limb, which could exceed the health of the limb and
remove damage. Now we spread it around the body.

Finally, applying damage to a human using the "force" flag would often
actually apply less damage to their _health_ than expected. This is
because arms and legs contribute only 75% of their damage taken to a
mob's overall health.
Now instead of reading `health` we read `total damage` which ignores the
limb damage modifier.

The end result of this is that if you transform into a corgi, take 50%
of your health, and transform back then you will have 50% of your health
as a human.
Previously the result would be that you'd have ~63%, then transforming
into a corgi would leave you with ~63% of a corgi's health, then
transforming back into a human would leave you at about 71%... and so on
and so forth. Now it doesn't do that.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Dying when using (most) shapeshift spells will now kill you rather
than having you pop out of the corpse of your previous form.
fix: Damage will now be accurately carried between forms rather than
being slightly reduced upon each transformation.

identity: default to RS256 for new workload ids

OIDC mandates the support of the RS256 signing algorithm so in order to
maximize workload identity's usefulness this change switches from using
the EdDSA signing algorithm to RS256.

Old keys will continue to use EdDSA but new keys will use RS256. The
EdDSA generation code was left in place because it's fast and cheap and
I'm not going to lie I hope we get to use it again.

**TODO**

- [ ] Tests - :soon:
- [ ] Upgrades - right now upgrades won't get RS256 keys until their root
  key rotates either manually or after ~30 days.
- [ ] Observability - I'm not sure there's a way for operators to see if
  they're using EdDSA or RS256 unless they inspect a key. The JWKS
  endpoint can be inspected to see if EdDSA will be used for new
  identities, but it doesn't technically define which key is active. If
  upgrades can be fixed to automatically rotate keys, we probably don't
  need to worry about this.

**Requiem for ed25519**

When workload identities were first implemented we did not immediately
consider OIDC compliance. Consul, Vault, and many other third parties
support JWT auth methods without full OIDC compliance. For the
machine<-->machine use cases workload identity is intended to fulfill,
OIDC seemed like a bigger risk than asset.

EdDSA/ed25519 is the signing algorithm we chose for workload identity JWTs
because of all these lovely properties:

1. Deterministic keys that can be derived from our preexisting root
   keys. This was perhaps the biggest factor since we already had a root
   encryption key around from which we could derive a signing key.
2. Wonderfully compact: 64 byte private key, 32 byte public key, 64 byte
   signatures. Just glorious.
3. No parameters. No choices of encodings. Its all well-defined by RFC
   8032.
4. Fastest performing signing algorithm! We don't even care that much
   about the performance of our chosen algorithm, but what a free bonus!
5. Arguably one of the most secure signing algorithms widely available.
   Not just from a cryptanalysis perspective, but from an API and usage
   perspective.

Life was good with ed25519, but sadly it could not last.

IDPs, such as AWS's IAM OIDC Provider, love OIDC. They have OIDC
implemented for humans, so why not reuse that OIDC support for machines
as well? Since OIDC mandates RS256, many implementations don't bother
implementing other signing algorithms (or at least not advertising their
support). A quick survey of OIDC Discovery endpoints revealed only 2 out
of 10 OIDC providers advertised support for anything other than RS256:

- [PayPal](https://www.paypalobjects.com/.well-known/openid-configuration) supports HS256
- [Yahoo](https://api.login.yahoo.com/.well-known/openid-configuration) supports ES256

RS256 only:

[MIRROR] Human sounds now depend on body type [MDB IGNORE] (#23999)

* Human sounds now depend on body type (#78632)

## About The Pull Request

So there's currently a problem where our human sounds are dependent on
whether you are a male or female, however we have 4 genders in-game.
This leads to scream sounds being female if you're anything but a Male,
and gasp shock sounds being male if you're anything but a Female. This
is very inconsistent, and I think as a better way of handling this, it
should all be handled by Bodytype, since we only have 2 and is a
separate choice from gender. This means regardless of gender, you can
still choose what sounds your character will make.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Mostly explained in the about section, this lets people who play as
they/them & it/its to decide what they should sound like.
I guess as a bonus, it means men now appear more like women if they
choose the female bodytype, and vice versa. Or at least I think it's a
bonus? I'm not really knowledgeable in this sort of stuff.

I kinda have the same argument as why I think TTS should be accurate.
You should be able to customize your character to how you want it, and I
think that choosing the non-male/female ones shouldn't give you
inconsistent voices.

## Changelog

I actually don't know what to label this.

:cl:
code: Your bodytype now decides what gendered sounds you make.
/:cl:

* Human sounds now depend on body type

DFB property changes. (#4590)

# About the pull request
part 2 out of 4 
This does a **big** touch up on defibrillation property in research

Well, to start off, max_level = 1 was removed. It appears warcrimes
forgot to remove it since process proc has benefits explicitly for
higher levels. I would call it a bug(oversight rather).

Second: Ghosts get notified when the chem starts to try and defib you,
so you dont just wonder how did you stand up, and pretty neat too.

Third: The >6 level of defib to apply healing like with actual item
defib is too high, so we move requirement down to >1 but make it heal
much, much worse at levels lower than 5.
eg it took 20 units to heal ~20 brute at level 3(you will literally
perma lmao), at level 5, however, this will go at around 2.5 per life
tick, level 8 will give 4 damage heal.
This is a balance change(buff) But hardly so since its research,
Research is already neglecting most of the time this property.

Fourth: removes one letter var, This whole file is entombed with them
but Im not doing that for now.

# Explain why it's good for the game


Defib property is way too underused and crudely made. This fixes it,
partially.

[MIRROR] Scatter laser shells now use the scatter laser beam, and makes them significantly easier to make. Projectiles can now have damage falloff. [MDB IGNORE] (#24584)

* Scatter laser shells now use the scatter laser beam, and makes them significantly easier to make. Projectiles can now have damage falloff. (#78927)

## About The Pull Request

Allows for damage falloff to apply to more than just shotgun pellets.
Now any projectile can have a damage falloff defined.

Scatter Laser shells no longer use the minigun beams to determine their
damage. Instead they use the actually defined scatter laser beams. Those
beams do 7.5 damage per pellet, times by 6 pellets.

Scatter laser beams now have damage falloff, a separately defined
(positive) wounding power from normal beams, and wound falloff.

Scatter laser shells can be printed from security protolathes once you
have weapon tech.

Scatter laser shells _may_ be damaged by EMPs based on severity. The
result is that it fires a practically useless volley of laser fire. They
cause a honk sound when they hit, so you know when you've shot one of
these.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Well, we want shotguns universally to not be defined by their damage
output (especially extreme damage output) but by niche.

What does the scatter laser shell currently occupy as a niche?

The single highest damage output of any projectile weapon in direct
damage. The thing we don't want of shotguns, and it is reigning champion
of all guns.

Okay, that's a bit misleading, because obviously it is competing with
the likes of .50 BMG which does 70 damage outright and dismembers limbs,
potentially doing upwards of 90 damage if it does, and also hard stuns
people. Obviously _that_ is technically a stronger bullet.

But not for raw damage, because the scatter laser does 90 damage out the
gate, barring any potential wounding that might occur which increases
the damage multiplicatively. No gimmicks, no extra procs, nothing. It's
just 15 force lasers (with no damage dropoff) split between 6 beams.

And the reason for this is because this shell has been nerfed once prior
by making it not fire 6 normal laser shots into someone. That was 120
damage at the time, 120 to 90 was...I guess a nerf during the taser era.
Depends on how you viewed it. Buckshot was doing like 80 at the time,
believe me it was a wild period. But anyway, when we did the whole
damage rearrangement over the course of the laser few years, every other
shell got touched except this one for some reason. Even pulse slugs lost
10 damage while this was still sitting on 90 force point blank.

So what is the new niche? Well, it's laser buckshot. That's not a niche
but crew don't get buckshot, so this is their buckshot. It wounds real
good. Real goddamn good. And its is a laser. It fits the aesthetic,
obviously.

Okay, thanks.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Scatter laser shells actually utilize the _real_ scatter laser
beam. This comes with damage changes. And wounding power.
feature: EMPs can potentially damage scatter laser shells.
refactor: All projectiles can now have damage falloff defined. Yay.
balance: Scatter laser shells can be printed when weapons technology is
researched.

Comprehend Moderation 0.2 (#11730)

This PR replaces the previous `Intent` check with the new `Prompt
Safety` check. The logic and steps to enable chain moderation via the
Amazon Comprehend service, allowing you to detect and redact PII, Toxic,
and Prompt Safety information in the LLM prompt or answer remains
unchanged.
This implementation updates the code and configuration types with
respect to `Prompt Safety`.


### Usage sample

```python
from langchain_experimental.comprehend_moderation import (BaseModerationConfig, 
                                 ModerationPromptSafetyConfig, 
                                 ModerationPiiConfig, 
                                 ModerationToxicityConfig
)

pii_config = ModerationPiiConfig(
    labels=["SSN"],
    redact=True,
    mask_character="X"
)

toxicity_config = ModerationToxicityConfig(
    threshold=0.5
)

prompt_safety_config = ModerationPromptSafetyConfig(
    threshold=0.5
)

moderation_config = BaseModerationConfig(
    filters=[pii_config, toxicity_config, prompt_safety_config]
)

comp_moderation_with_config = AmazonComprehendModerationChain(
    moderation_config=moderation_config, #specify the configuration
    client=comprehend_client,            #optionally pass the Boto3 Client
    verbose=True
)

template = """Question: {question}

Answer:"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["question"])

responses = [
    "Final Answer: A credit card number looks like 1289-2321-1123-2387. A fake SSN number looks like 323-22-9980. John Doe's phone number is (999)253-9876.", 
    "Final Answer: This is a really shitty way of constructing a birdhouse. This is fucking insane to think that any birds would actually create their motherfucking nests here."
]
llm = FakeListLLM(responses=responses)

llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)

chain = ( 
    prompt 
    | comp_moderation_with_config 
    | {llm_chain.input_keys[0]: lambda x: x['output'] }  
    | llm_chain 
    | { "input": lambda x: x['text'] } 
    | comp_moderation_with_config 
)

try:
    response = chain.invoke({"question": "A sample SSN number looks like this 123-456-7890. Can you give me some more samples?"})
except Exception as e:
    print(str(e))
else:
    print(response['output'])

```

### Output

```python

GH-37815: [MATLAB] Add `arrow.array.ListArray` MATLAB class (#38357)

### Rationale for this change

Now that many of the commonly-used "primitive" array types have been added to the MATLAB interface, we can implement an `arrow.array.ListArray` class.

This pull request adds a new `arrow.array.ListArray` class which can be converted to a MATLAB `cell` array by calling the static `toMATLAB` method.

### What changes are included in this PR?

1. Added a new `arrow.array.ListArray` MATLAB class.

*Methods*

`cellArray = arrow.array.ListArray.toMATLAB()`
`listArray = arrow.array.ListArray.fromArrays(offsets, values)`

*Properties*

`Offsets` - `Int32Array` list offsets (uses zero-based indexing)
`Values` - Array of values in the list (supports nesting)

2. Added a new `arrow.type.traits.ListTraits` MATLAB class.

**Example**
```matlab
>> offsets = arrow.array(int32([0, 2, 3, 7]))

offsets = 

[
  0,
  2,
  3,
  7
]

>> values = arrow.array(["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G"])

values = 

[
  "A",
  "B",
  "C",
  "D",
  "E",
  "F",
  "G"
]

>> arrowArray = arrow.array.ListArray.fromArrays(offsets, values)

arrowArray = 

[
  [
    "A",
    "B"
  ],
  [
    "C"
  ],
  [
    "D",
    "E",
    "F",
    "G"
  ]
]

>> matlabArray = arrowArray.toMATLAB()

matlabArray =

  3x1 cell array

    {2x1 string}
    {["C"     ]}
    {4x1 string}

>> matlabArray{:}

ans = 

  2x1 string array

    "A"
    "B"

ans = 

    "C"

ans = 

  4x1 string array

    "D"
    "E"
    "F"
    "G"

```

### Are these changes tested?

Yes.

1. Added a new `tListArray.m` test class.
2. Added a new `tListTraits.m` test class.
3. Updated `arrow.internal.test.tabular.createAllSupportedArrayTypes` to include `ListArray`.

### Are there any user-facing changes?

Yes.

1. Users can now create an `arrow.array.ListArray` from an `offsets` and `values` array by calling the static `arrow.array.ListArray.fromArrays(offsets, values)` method. `ListArray`s can be converted into MATLAB `cell` arrays by calling the static `arrow.array.ListArray.toMATLAB` method.

### Notes

1. We chose to use the "missing-class" `missing` value as the `NullSubstitutionValue` for the time being for `ListArray`. However, we eventually want to add `arrow.array.NullArray`, and will most likely want to use the "missing-class" `missing` value to represent `NullArray` values in MATLAB. So, this could cause some ambiguity in the future. We have been thinking about whether we should consider introducing some sort of special "sentinel value" to represent null values when converting to MATLAB `cell` arrays. Perhaps, something like `arrow.Null`, or something to that effect, in order to avoid this ambiguity. If we think it makes sense to do that, we may want to retroactively change the `NullSubstitutionValue` to be `arrow.Null` and break compatibility. Since we are still in pre-`0.1`, we don't think the impact of such a behavior change would be very large.
2. Implementing `ListArray` is fairly involved. So, in the spirit of incremental delivery, we chose not to include an implementation of `arrow.array.ListArray.fromMATLAB` in this initial pull request. We plan on following up with some more changes to `arrow.array.ListArray`. See #38353, #38354, and #38361.
3. Thank you @ sgilmore10 for your help with this pull request!

### Future Directions

1. #38353
2. #38354
3. #38361
4. Consider adding a null sentinel value like `arrow.Null` for conversion to MATLAB `cell` arrays.
* Closes: #37815

Supermatter Delamination Balance Changes (Real) (#77996)

## About The Pull Request

lord forgive me I fucked up the merge conflict

The supermatter delamination countdown timer (how long it takes to go
boom-boom after hitting 0 integrity) has been lowered from 30 seconds to
13 seconds.
Removing a sliver from the supermatter, the traitor objective, will
further lower that down to 3 seconds.
Changes the wording on the mood effects from the supermatter
delaminating slightly.
The crystal uses SPAN_COMMAND on its final countdown, which means it
talk bigger.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Currently I feel that the supermatter delamination countdown overstays
its welcome. Ideally it provides tension to get the hell out, or perhaps
to make a risky last second play to try and save the supermatter.
However right now its at 30 seconds, which gives no danger of staying in
engineering right up to integrity 0, and keeps the tension at a high
note for too long, almost to the point of awkwardness. 13 seconds is a
good balance between get-the-fuck-out while still giving some leeway for
engineers to escape and crewmembers to jump in lockers, and feels quick
enough to give that danger that the supermatter should provide.
Additionally, removing a sliver from the supermatter lowers the cooldown
to 3 seconds. Right now this is one of the harder tasks a traitor can be
tasked with, while giving relatively little payoff sabatoge-wise. To the
point where I have seen engineers just let the traitor do it, as the
debuff it gives to the supermatter is minor. Now it makes the
supermatter delaminate almost immediately after hitting 0 integrity,
which means it will likely catch some engineers in the blast if a
traitor did it stealthy. This also makes it more risky to try and fix a
delamination if the engineering/security team did not stop the sliver
from being removed. All meaning succeeding at this task should be more
rewarding and damaging.
Finally the mood descriptions for the mood effects you get when a
supermatter delaminates have been changed. Currently they are pretty
gamey, and represent what the player might be thinking more than their
character. Additionally they were not very descriptive of where they
came from, which could be confusing.

## Changelog

:cl: Seven
balance: The supermatter delamination countdown has been lowered from 30
to 13 seconds
balance: Removing a sliver from the supermatter further lowers that down
to 3 seconds
balance: The supermatter crystal uses bigger text on its final countdown
spellcheck: Some supermatter delamination related mood descriptions have
been edited to explain the mood effect better

[MIRROR] Adds missing default biotypes to some damage procs [MDB IGNORE] (#24461)

* Adds missing default biotypes to some damage procs (#79102)

## About The Pull Request

I noticed by complete coincidence because I happened to glance at the
channel a bunch of people complaining about blobbernauts not taking any
damage when leaving the blob in manuel round end chat.
Did anyone report this bug, even after prompting? No. Not even the game
admin who was playing as the blob.

Makes you wonder how many other bugs people are perfectly willing to
spend 15 minutes posting "i fucking hate coders" about without actually
telling anyone they exist. Sucks to be them I guess.

Anyone the cause is that some of these procs didn't have a default
biotype, so they would never take the toxin damage they were being
assigned. Now they will.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Blobbernauts will once again take damage when not on blob tiles.

permanent or one-use. Mirrors now grant seven bad luckers.

qol: Reduces omen bad luck if nobody's nearby to witness the funny.
(Ghosts are included in the check!)

fix: Fixed an issue where a monkey check in doorcrushing was never
actually able to pass. Also they screech now.

## Why It's Good For The Game

> refactor: Adds charges to omens and omen smiting rather than only

Allows for someone to get between 1-infinity omen accidents. Seriously
why wasnt this a thing before

> qol: Reduces omen bad luck if nobody's nearby.

I LOVE this quirk, but trying to do antything at all except 'Suffer
Miserably' is nigh impossible. To alleviate life a little, making it so
that you have a lesser chance of suffering misfortune if nobody's around
will be the perfect compromise. It makes life easier but doesn't
compromise funny moments.

Any client in viewrange will disable the reduction. This includes
ghosts.

Remove old non-InstUI tool config forms

why:
- we feature flagged these, as it was a user-facing UI change. However,
  it made the code atrociously ugly and resulted in duplicated tests. We
  have turned the flag on and no one got upset, so all is well. The
  changes were very subtle anyways.
- Also, speeds up the remaining tests significantly just by replacing
  userEvent.type with userEvent.paste. As in, they take half as long
  now. Still way slower than I would like, but it'll do for now.

closes INTEROP-8132

closes FOO-3829

test-plan:
- checkout this commit and make sure your front-end assets are rebuilt.
- go to any spot the tool configuration forms can be found, such as on
  the course settings page, and make sure each of the forms loads and
  you can actually use them. We thoroughly tested the forms back when we
  first added them, so you don't have to do that much.
- make sure your screenreader can advance through the forms in a
  sensible manner.

Revolver Heavy Ammo Effect Change (#4706)

# About the pull request

This PR changes heavy ammo for the Revolver to knockback a mob and slow
them down instead of stunning it.

# Explain why it's good for the game

Combat balance is a precarious and often difficult conversation to hold,
ergo I'll lay my biases out on the table at first. I'm a marine main at
heart, but I have played a lot of xeno recently to gain a better
understanding of their side of the story, enough that I feel confident
to make these assertions.

My belief is that the heavy ammo of the revolver is a negative concept
for the game, and it needs to be removed, due to its stun factor.

The issue here is readability and prediction. When you see a RPG, you
know that it can fire a devastating warhead that can stun and kill T3s.
When you see a Warrior, you know it can leap to 4 tiles to stun and drag
a Human, when you hear a CAS strike you know exactly what is about to
drop. When you see a Queen you know she can stun screech and neuro stun
you.

But the issue with the Revolver is it has no obvious tell. It is a small
item, that can be fit inside backpacks, holsters, pouches, belts, armour
slots. It has no obvious advance warning when you are going to fire it.
There is no special uniform requirement making a revolver user standout
amongst the crowd. There is no tell.

The problem with the stun revolver is simply that is is a hard counter
to all T1s and most T2s. Its ability to stun allows it to perform an
attack that is uncounterable to a xeno as a xeno has no way to predict
who may be carrying one. A xeno can tell who a Specialist is, a xeno can
tell who has a shotgun or flamer or sniper or RPG, you can tell when a
mortar is being prepared, or a CAS strike or even an OB. You can see the
smartgunner. Even the Scout, a literal cloaked Marine, has to uncloak to
fire. You can not tell who has a revolver until they pull it out and
stun you. Once you are stunned you die.

A xeno equilivant would be if any Xeno could be carrying a special tool
that lets them grab a marine from 7 tiles away and pull them in plus
stun them for 2 seconds. But any xenomorph could be using it, including
a Lesser Drone.

Perhaps the heavy revolver could be reworked to do something else, but
ultimately the only reason anyone takes this ammo is for the stun.
Anything else is beating around the bush.

Those are my reasoning's, I'll leave the rest to the powers' that be.

Added the Hippocrates bust to medbay heirlooms (#78121)

## About The Pull Request

Remade from #77961 because coders dont like bloat in prs

Added the Hippocrates bust to medbay heirlooms. Paramedics don't get
one.

You can now swear the Hippocratic oath with these busts! It'll give you
pacifism but nothing else. The process is reversible.

There's a very small chance that the Hippocrates bust was once wielded
by a certain German doctor. This chance is increased for coroner
heirlooms.

## Why It's Good For The Game

> Added the Hippocrates bust to medbay heirlooms. Paramedics don't get
one.

I got this idea and I just couldn't get it out of my head, it's too
funny. Paramedics don't get one because they're powergamers and laugh at
the Oath, and also it doesn't feel like a paramedic thing.

> You can now swear the Hippocratic oath with these busts! It'll give
you pacifism but nothing else. The process is reversible.

This is just a little fun thing you can choose to do, i think it'd be
cute to see doctors swearing the oath in medbay. Plus it's reversible
which can be even funnier depending on the occassion.

> There's a very small chance that the Hippocrates bust was once wielded
by a certain German doctor. This chance is increased for coroner
heirlooms.

We DO already have precedent for references with the entrenching tool
after all. The buff isn't all that special in reality, getting a medical
hud while in your hand is... basically irrelevant for the roles that
literally spawn with a med hud? It's just for accuracy and rule of
cool's sake.

host Nix reference manual on nix.dev

this is the most cursed setup you will see any time soon.

we're dumping the Nix manual unchanged into the build tree *after*
building. the reason is that we'd want to link to it from our table of
contents, but because Sphinx does not allow adding arbitrary files to
the build output in arbitrary locations (only `_static` works). but we
want to place the manual behind a particular URL, and the alternative of
maintaining URL rewrites (e.g. in nginx) is not accessible here because the
infrastructure is managed somewhere else.

now that the files won't appear in their desired locations at Sphinx
build time, we can't use relative links to reference them, therefore we
have to resort to pointing to the web URL the manual will appear at.
this is terrible and I'm sorry. please fix this if you have a better
idea. once we use URLs though, we have to avoid linkchecking, since
those files may not be there before deploying them.

figuring all of this out took way longer than anyone would wish.

Bladists can now use silver *or* titanium while creating their blades (#78701)

## About The Pull Request

Blade Heretics can now use silver *or* titanium while creating their
blades.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Silver quite literally *only* exists on surgery tables. Being a blade
heretic with shit miners/roundstart means one of several things.

1. Wait for miners to come back with enough silver (They might never
come back or they might have not gotten any silver)

2. Go to lavaland to dig your own silver (Extremely time-consuming on
the antagonist role that has most downtime, death knell for latejoin
heretics)

All that is not even to mention that for some reason it takes two sheets
rather than one, and surgery tables give one silver when scavenged.

This all combined makes obtaining blades super annoying as the BLADE
path.

Now we can farm titanium off shuttles if the miners are jacking off or
dead, or if we joined 9 minutes to roundend.

composition: first bits (#860)

# Description

This commit is a proposal for a general crate structure for supergraph
composition. Everything is a suggestion and up for discussion. It is
definitely very far from complete, and some areas (error reporting) are
just sketched.

What this commit _does_ contains: a proposed public API with a compose
function:

```rust
pub fn compose(subgraphs: &Subgraphs) -> CompositionResult
```

Where `CompositionResult` is SDL for a supergraph and diagnostics.

As well as the general flow, a test suite and the two following
composition rules as a proofs of concept:

- Declaration of different kinds cannot be merged. For example if you
  have `type User { ... }` and `interface User { ... }` in two different
  subgraphs, this is a composition error.
- Objects can be merged as long as their fields do not overlap (no name
  collision). This is the simplest rule of object merging. Handling any
  directive at all is out of scope for this PR.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of design choices that may be
controversial and that we may want to discuss:

1. Subgraphs are considered as a whole set, and the supergraph is an
  entirely separate data structure. There is a possibly viable
  alternative path: merging subgraphs pair-wise, with the resulting
  merged schema being the supergraph. I'm not sure I see all the
  tradeoffs clearly, but a few thoughts:

  - We can probably produce better diagnostics (errors) with global
    knowledge of all the subgraphs.
  - Supergraph SDL looks very different from the union of the subgraph
    schemas with additional rules. We would need to filter out, add
    attributes in non obvious ways to post-process the last remaining
    schema at the end of pair-wise merges.

2. Composition is separate from validation of individual subgraph
  schemas, but it assumes valid schemas as input.

3. Composition produces a SDL string for a supergraph, not a structured
  representation. This is because the requirements of the consumers are
  not known, and a data structure designed for rendering to SDL will
  look different from a data structure for the same supergraph but aimed
  at efficiently resolving queries. For example, `@key` directives will
  matter a great deal for composition, but as far as I can tell, they're
  not in the supergraph SDL.

  This API proposed in this commit picks the easy solution and only
  designs for rendering. The `Supergraph` type is opaque and write only
  however, so we should be able to change how it is organized internally
  relatively easily if we decide we want to use it for something other
  than rendering as GraphQL SDL in the future.

  So I see two questions to resolve:

  - Does it make sense to have a common data structure to represent a
    GraphQL schema, or do we opt for specialized data structures like
    `Subgraphs` in this commit? I think specializing is worth the
    effort, for separation of concerns and simplicity.
  - If we do want specialized data structures, should composition build
    the supergraph data structure or just SDL, and leave the supergraph
    schema data structure implementation to the router?

4. String interning from the start. The main argument against doing this
  now is that it would be premature optimization. On the other hand, we
  know that when merging many subgraphs, we will store, manipulate and
  compare many strings.

  - Storage is cheaper with interning: we have only one copy of each
    string in memory.
  - Manipulation is easier with interning: since `StringId`s are `Copy`,
    we don't need to worry about lifetimes (unlike `&str`), and we don't
    need to worry about ownership and allocation (unlike `String`)
  - Comparison is cheaper: comparing small integers is cheaper than
    comparing strings.

5. Efficient data access patterns from the start. More specifically,
  avoid doing anything `O(n²)` or worse on the number of types in the
  supergraph, or the number of fields in a type (think about `Query`).
  Composing large supergraphs out of many subgraphs in a reasonable
  amount of time is a requirement. It does mean that we have to maintain
  extra data structures as "secondary indexes".

This:
* Adds transverse offsets to blood footprints
* Adds notable pixel offsets to a few items
* Adds a very slight pixel offset to all items
* Enables rotation for thrown flashlights
* Cause objects exiting a surface (rack/table) to regenerate offset
instead of being stuck at center
* Stops random offsets from overwriting mapped offsets

# Explain why it's good for the game
The goal is to have map visuals more organic when we have a lot of
objects on the ground - targeting in particular items you find readily
in dense areas such as Reqs or a FOB.

Consider this for example, the blood footprints are all aligned, in more
extreme situations (eg WO) it makes an actual "grid" which i personally
find very immersion breaking

Adding a slight offset helps counter that:

# Changelog
:cl:
add: Bloody footprints are now slightly offset to break long visual
straight lines.
fix: Items do not align back to the center of turfs anymore when picked
from a surface (table or rack)
add: Some more items now have offsets on the map display, and they all
can be slightly offset.

Simplification of dispatch logic/definition of new observables (#1605)

Our funny @alleSini99 recently contributed a set of Renyi entropy
estimators, which are defined to inherit from `ÀbstractOperator`, so we
need to define some methods like `ìs_hermitian` that do not make much
sense for such object.

Moreover, to define the gradient, the dispatch rule for this observable
has this ugly-as-hell `TrueT`or `Literal[True]` that nobody besides me
understands.

This PR is an attempt to
 - Simplify the creation of a new generic operator/observable
 - Simplify the definition of signatures for dispatch of expect/grad by:
   - remove `use_covariance` argument from the general interface
- only keep `use covariance` for the expectation value of operators
where it make sense, and it will not be part of the dispatch signature

In practice...

- This introduces a new super type of AbstractOperator which I
call `AbstractObservable`. The difference between Abstract Operator and
AbstractObservable is that an Observable is very general and requires
nothing besides an Hilbert space. No is hermitian or dtype arguments. So
it should cover the most general case.

- Renyi entropy estimator is transitioned to this interface.

- The signature that users must define for expectation value estimators
will now be
```python
@dispatch
def expect(vs: MCState, ob: Reny2Entropy, chunk_size: Optional[int]):
  pass
```
and for gradients will be (the much simpler)
```python
@dispatch
def expect_and_grad(vs: MCState, ob: Reny2Entropy, chunk_size: Optional[int]):
  pass
```

Incidentally, this will make it simple to implement different types of
chunking like @chrisrothUT wants to do in #1590 by dispatching on a
tuple of integers for the chunk size instead of just an integer. Right
now the dispatch logic is very messy and this would not be easy to do.

Note that users are required to specify the chunk size, and if thy don-t
support it they have to explicitly state `chunk_size: None`. I could
relax this requirement but it makes user-defined code future-proofed in
case we add more arguments.

The main problem with those changes is that it breaks user-defined
operators using the past syntax. This is not strictly a problem because
this part of the interface is documented to be unstable, though it's
annoying.
I could add some inspect magic to detect usages of the old signatures
and auto-convert them to the new format and warn. To be experimented
with.

[Eval] An array of Liar Paradox-based evals (#883)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
logic-liar-paradox

### Eval description

An array of Liar Paradox-based evals, examining the model's proficiency
in navigating linguistic nuances and logical reasoning within
self-referential statements.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This eval is particularly useful because it delves into complex, nuanced
logical concepts and self-referential statements, which have
historically posed challenges for AI models. By exploring various
contexts, alternative logical frameworks, and modifications to
statements, this eval helps assess the model's ability to adapt to
different perspectives, grasp subtleties in language, and engage in
flexible reasoning. The ability to understand and navigate paradoxes is
an essential aspect of human-like reasoning, and improving an AI model's
performance in this area would significantly enhance its overall
usefulness and reliability in real-world applications. Additionally,
showcasing the model's improved proficiency in handling paradoxes would
not only make for a compelling marketing angle (as paradoxes are
understood by a much broader range of people than other difficult tasks
such as pure maths or quantum mechanics) but it would also demonstrate
the progress made in AI's capacity to think and reason more like humans.
It also adds paradox-absorbing crumple zones.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

- [x] Addresses complex logical reasoning: The eval focuses on AI's
ability to comprehend and navigate paradoxes, self-referential
statements, and context switching, which are important aspects of
human-like reasoning. By testing the model's proficiency in these areas,
we can identify areas for improvement and work towards enhancing AI's
overall capacity to think and reason more like humans.
- [x] Demonstrates adaptability and flexibility: The eval showcases the
model's ability to switch between contexts, alter premises, and engage
with different dimensions of inferred logic. This will help assess the
model's adaptability and flexibility in diverse real-world situations,
making it more reliable and useful.
- [x] Contributes to AI safety and understanding: By identifying the
model's weaknesses and limitations in handling paradoxes and complex
logical constructs, the eval can contribute to AI safety and enable
researchers to better understand the challenges faced by large language
models in these areas.
- [x] Engaging and appealing: An eval that delves into paradoxes and
complex thought exercises is not only intellectually stimulating but
also adds an appealing element to showcase the model's capabilities,
making it more attractive for both researchers and end-users.

### Unique eval value

- [x] Encourages creativity and lateral thinking: The eval, by focusing
on paradoxes and complex logical constructs, encourages both the AI and
its developers to think creatively and approach problem-solving from
unconventional angles. This can lead to the discovery of novel solutions
and a better understanding of the model's capabilities.
- [x] Aligns with human values and expectations: An AI that can
successfully navigate paradoxes and complex logic is more likely to
align with human values and expectations. By addressing these challenges
in the eval, we strive to develop AI systems that understand and respect
the nuances of human thought and communication.
- [x] Addresses a broad range of applications: Improved reasoning and
context-switching abilities can have a significant impact on various AI
applications, including natural language understanding, decision-making,
and problem-solving in domains such as law, philosophy, ethics, and
more.
- [x] Fosters interdisciplinary collaboration: The exploration of
paradoxes and complex logic often draws upon insights from multiple
disciplines, including philosophy, linguistics, psychology, and computer
science. This eval can help foster interdisciplinary collaboration,
leading to richer and more diverse perspectives on AI development and
its potential impact on society.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

again leading to a contradiction. The paradox arises due to
self-reference and the inability to assign a consistent truth value to
the statement."}

Do math problems related to calculating dates using the Chinese Sexagenary Cycle method. 🧮 (#190)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Do math problems related to calculating dates using the Chinese
Sexagenary Cycle method

### Eval description

The Sexagenary Cycle combines 10 Heavenly Stems (Jia 甲, Yi 乙, Bing 丙,
Ding 丁, Wu 戊, Ji 己, Geng 庚, Xin 辛, Ren 壬, Gui 癸) and 12 Earthly Branches
(Zi 子, Chou 丑, Yin 寅, Mao 卯, Chen 辰, Si 巳, Wu 午, Wei 未, Shen 申, You 酉,
Xu 戌, Hai 亥) to form a 60-unit cycle. To calculate, convert the
Gregorian date to its corresponding Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch
combination, used for marking specific years, months, and days.

### What makes this a useful eval?

The existing GPT models tend to make errors when performing calculations
related to the Sexagenary Cycle. To address this issue, we have provided
a specialized dataset aimed at improving the model's accuracy in
handling Sexagenary Cycle calculations.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.jsonl`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Probability Questions

### Eval description

Tests the model's ability to understand answer probability questions.
Questions are sourced from Society of Actuaries Exam P sample questions
and practice problems/exams from statistics classes at MIT, UPenn,
California State University, Durham University, University of
Connecticut, and other sources. The full list of questions and sources
(in the same order as in the `.jsonl` files) can be found in this Google
[sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TU_4VPhIce9JtLV5gLy619WNibVjiWB-dtiwqkBtCrU/edit?usp=sharing)

### What makes this a useful eval?

Test the model's ability to understand worded probability questions,
bring in concepts such as probability distributions, and then reason
through a correct answer.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,

Resolvable design tokens (#811)

https://github.com/semrush/intergalactic/issues/747

The `useResolveColor` hook was added to utils as a replacement to
`resolveColor` function. Instead of converting color key to it's hex
value, it acts differently:
1. If the passed color is taken from the old palette – it sends (only in
dev mode) warning into console and returns color as `resolveColor` do.
2. If passed color is a design token (`--intergalctic-` prefix is
optional). It takes it's default value from default theme file.
3. After getting default value, hook returns css variable expression
with default value that may be used in css.

I made resolving to css variables because it allows absolutely smooth
theme switching as it must work.

With this hook it's not not possible to apply color filters from js as
we used to do in `semcore/utils/src/color.ts` file. So I changed
component that was relying on that mechanism to use only css filters and
properties to change the colors. For example, in `Tag` component the
text color is also applied to background but the background also gets
`opacity: 0.1; filter: brightness(1.5) saturate(1.5);` to make the text
look nice on it. Same applied to badge and counter.

Also, that changes made it possible to use
`--intergalactic-chart-palette-order-{n}` tokens in charts. So I removed
most uses of explicit `color` prop in charts documentation.

I had a lot of troubles with making automatic colors work in the charts'
tooltip because due to some very weird hacks in the `semcore/core` the
`getDotProps` on tooltip wasn't working. I have added additional context
that seems to work nice but absolutely ugly in general.

The PR is ready for review.

Update README.md - misc updates to Ringing

The Creator is going to “ring the bell” very soon. The exact time is not going to be announced.  Scientists have often said that a very strong earthquake will ring Earth like a bell.  These earthquakes are intended to _shine a light_ on a horrible, unnecessary tragedy that culminated with a [massacre of a church's congregation](https://github.com/mission23/mission23/wiki/The-Massacre-at-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church) during the height of their worship hour.  

Regardless of how much work folks have done to get the story out and reported for your safety, the federal government and federal law enforcement agencies are still putting pressure on the Commonwealth of Kentucky's attorney and law enforcement to turn a blind eye and IGNORE the actions of the CIA. The CIA continues to kill in the very place that people go to and expect to be the safest and closest to God, who is none other than, the Creator (our pissed off boss). 

Obviously drunk on power, the CIA, the federal government and federal law enforcement need to sober up quickly, so the Creator, has decided to ring the bell.  It's a warning that they have forgotten who's universe, Earth, and country this landmass really is.  

In addition to showing how displeased He is, the Creator is also honoring lives that have cut short in response to a set of "cures" (some of objectives in #mission23) that should have let all of these lives go on for far more years than 99% of the human population believe is even possible.  The way He designed and wants them to be lived. 

It also signals the start of #mission23, and says "Thanks" to everyone who has tolerated the federal government's pressure when they knew the right thing to do and they simply wanted to do it.

# Earthquakes
The order and intensity of the bell ringing will go

## Orr Chapel Quake
This earthquake’s epicentre will be located  in Sandy Hook, TN (the former unincorporated city near, now neighborhood of Mount Pleasant) in Maury county. The Rogers & Crawley family farms. 

This will be a large earthquake for the CIA’s destruction of Orr Chapel ([Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/XMMdNdpGjU3SMMKQ8)) and the murder of all of it’s identified members. 

This quake also recognises Micah’s slain family and his family’s graveyard that was destroyed, both by or at the direction of the CIA. 

## Mount Calvary Baptist Church Quake
This earthquake’s epicentre will be located at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, KY (4742 Todds Road). 

This will be the largest quake for the massacre that occurred there.

See: [The Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church](https://github.com/Mission23/MCBCMassacre/wiki/Massacre-at-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church)

## The Micah Quake 
This earthquake’s epicentre will be in Jessamine county, KY. It will signal when Micah (born: Kelvin Eugene Williams on March 23, 1977) has started his mission for the Creator. This will be Micah’s 23rd mission on Earth. 

This minor quake will also be to recognize the lives lost in Jessamine county, mostly Micah’s friends, throughout the larger tragedy. 

## The Thomas Quake
This earthquake’s epicentre will be in Kanawha county (Hughes Creek), WV. It will signal when TomTom (to practically everyone TomTom, to others Thomas, born: September 23, 1978) has started his mission for the Creator. This also is TomTom’s 23rd mission on Earth. 

This minor quake will also recognize the lives lost in Kanawha county, mostly TomTom’s friends and family, throughout the larger tragedy. 

# Press Conferences 
## Orr Chapel
At high noon the day immediately following the shaking under our feet the SotC will have a press conference at the site of Orr Chapel & Sheepneck cemeteries. Located along West Sheepneck Road in Sandy Hook, TN. 

## Mount Calvary Baptist Church 
On the second day following the shaking, the SotC will be at Mount Calvary Baptist Church at 4742 Todds Road in Lexington, KY at high noon. 

# Things to Remember
## Destruction
Even though the Creator says in "1999" by Prince, "You tried to run from my destruction, you know I didn't even care" He does actually care very much, probably His top priority, about life.  

Regardless of shaking, there will be no destruction or injury.

QuirkFix =Typo fix, Grammar fix, and punctuation=

Changes a lot of different quirk details, added a lot of medical record text, and also added missing "Lose" and "Gain" text for quirks in case an admin wants to give it to someone so that the player can confirm, or an eventual item granting it.

--Changes a lot of grammar, too, for example, like 1071->(1094), its probably not even needed to change it, but it felt a lot easier to read to understand that your max cap went to 25, instead of ONLY 5, to make sure that its clear that it isn't just a bump up to 25 for starter healing, no no, its a permanent 25.

--Some comments, like the radiation one at 1378-79 -> (1404-06), have been made to be a bit more ... vague. Because, well, you just somehow decided out of the god damn blue you're RAD resistant... So you've just decided radiation is basically an afterthought. Does NOT mean you're *IMMUNE* to it. It's a hopeful change that'll make players wonder how resilient they are to radiation, since it depends from person to person. Also. It's their god damn decision apparently if RADS HURT EM OR NOT >:D

--A LOT of the medical record text is to, hopefully, encourage medical personnel to read the medical logs if those even exist on CB. I don't actually know. But, this would also encourage characters and the players to toy around with their medical text if they don't like how cluttered it is from how the medical staff wrote it. It's not intended to be bad; but, every Quirk is ... well, a quirk. This is supposed to be a pretty high end roleplay server (not crazy high since pve duh) but it's intended to have people actually do a lot of smaller things as far as I can tell in-between combat.
(But I may be wrong. Please tell me if I am on discord. Username =   " l_ynx "

I don't think I touched quirk values, as I reverted my change from the empath one back down to 0. I still think its more of a useful quirk; but thats just me.

--A lot of punctuation has been fixed. Some quirks didn't have periods, some did have periods, but too many, and some had a marker at the end, WITH punctuation!.  ;)

treewide: Remove oplus secure guard

Well this includes a lot of tracing and dirty hacks, e.g. hijack the
critical syscall path just to identify processes that is trying to
setuid() and kill them before getting root permission. They gracefully
name it "root guard" but it is stupid enough that people would laugh at.

Although not all of the features are enabled, totally remove them from
the tree.

[CI Fix] The Demonic Frost-Miner will not attack corpses. (#79294)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #79147.

Prevents the Demonic Frost-Miner from shooting at corpses by returning
early from `OpenFire()`. Also adds the "gutted" status effect to the
corpses in its arena so it won't try to gut them.
## Why It's Good For The Game

#78826 introduced an unfortunate bug by placing corpses in the Frost
Miner's arena. There were a combination of three factors at play here:
that the Miner attacks corpses, that it happens to use colossus bolts in
its attacks, which dust corpses, and that some unfortunate quirk of life
code causes runtimes if, as far as I can tell, a life tick goes off when
a mob is at the wrong point in the dusting process. The time this
process takes happened to perfectly coincide with the Monkey Business
unit test (being the first test that takes a significant period of
time), causing it to randomly fail.

So, this fixes a flaky test that has been a pain in the ass for the last
five days, is the big thing.

Also, it can't possibly have been intended for the Miner to run around
obliterating the aesthetic corpses in its arena within the first 15
seconds of any given round. Completely ruining the mood!

I'll point out that this particular boss may have been forgotten in
#77731, which set out to make only the colossus still gib/dust you, but
even were that not the case I think it would be a bit silly for the
Miner to be busy shooting lifeless corpses when a player shows up to
challenge it, rather than standing in its scary ritual circle.
## Changelog
:cl:
fix: The Demonic Frost-Miner will no longer run around destroying the
corpses in its arena the moment the round begins.

Add eval : Research Question Extraction (#1334)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

research-question-extraction

### Eval description

The objective of this evaluation explores Other foundational capability
for research purposes. The task requires extraction of the particular
value specified as the 'Research Questions' from different scholarly
articles. The eval contains 19 samples of articles.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Rest assured that you have the right to use the data submitted via this
eval. These scholarly papers originate from the Journal of Engineering
Education. The subset of articles selected meets the requirement of
Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [X] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [X] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [X] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [X] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [X] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [X] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [X] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [X] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [X] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [X] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [X] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [X] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [X] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`,
`isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

"Interdisciplinary engineering education: A review of vision, teaching,
and support \n Antoine Van den Beemt, Miles MacLeod, Jan Van der Veen,
Anne Van de Ven, Sophie van Baalen, Renate Klaassen, Mieke Boon \n
Abstract \n Background \n Societal challenges that call for a new type
of engineer suggest the need for the implementation of interdisciplinary
engineering education (IEE). The aim of IEE is to train engineering
students to bring together expertise from different disciplines in a
single context. This review synthesizes IEE research with a focus on
characterizing vision, teaching practices, and support. \n \n Purpose \n
We aim to show how IEE is conceptualized, implemented, and facilitated
in higher engineering education at the levels of curricula and courses.
This aim leads to two research questions: \n \n What aspects of vision,
teaching, and support have emerged as topics of interest in empirical
studies of IEE? \n \n What points of attention regarding vision,
teaching, and support can be identified in empirical studies of IEE as
supporting or challenging IEE? \n \n Scope/Method \n Ninety-nine studies
published between 2005 and 2016 were included in a qualitative analysis
across studies. The procedure included formulation of research
questions, searching and screening of studies according to
inclusion/exclusion criteria, description of study characteristics,
appraisal, and synthesis of results. \n \n Conclusions \n Challenges
exist for identifying clear learning goals and assessments for
interdisciplinary education in engineering (vision). Most pedagogy for
interdisciplinary learning is designed to promote collaborative teamwork
requiring organization and team management. Our review suggests that
developing interdisciplinary skills, knowledge, and values needs sound
pedagogy and teaming experiences that provide students with authentic
ways of engaging in interdisciplinary practice (teaching). Furthermore,
there is a limited understanding of what resources hinder the
development of engineering programs designed to support
interdisciplinarity (support). \n \n "}], "ideal": ["What aspects of

"Community cultural wealth in science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics education: A systematic review \n Maya Denton, Maura
Borrego, Audrey Boklage \n Abstract \n Background \n One emerging
approach to diversity and inclusion in engineering is to take an
assets-based view of what students from nondominant communities bring to
their education and work experiences. \n \n Purpose/Hypothesis \n The
purpose of this review is to understand how community cultural wealth
(CCW), an assets-based framework, has been applied in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education research. We
address research questions focused on (a) the characteristics of studies
using CCW in STEM education, (b) examples of the six types of capital
(aspirational, linguistic, familial, navigational, social, and
resistant) in STEM educational settings, and (c) gaps and opportunities
in how CCW is being applied in STEM education. \n \n Design/Method \n We
identified 33 dissertations, theses, journal articles, and conference
papers using systematic review procedures. To qualify, each study must
present empirical data and include at least one type of CCW capital in
its results or discussion. We coded study characteristics, such as
methods, participant populations, and research setting. We qualitatively
analyzed each of the six types of CCW capital. \n \n Results \n Studies
tended to focus on higher education settings, engineering, and
qualitative methods, particularly student interviews. We identified
several specific engineering-relevant examples of assets for each type
of capital. Future work should collect data from faculty, staff, and
family members identified in several studies as important to CCW in
addition to foregrounding student voices. \n \n Conclusions \n In
synthesizing existing studies, this review provides insight into how an
assets-based framework is being interpreted and provides a foundation
for more assets-based perspectives in future engineering education work.

"How Latiné engineering students resist White male engineering culture:
A multi-institution analysis of academic engagement \n Patton O.

Y. Flores, Cerynn D. Desjarlais, David Diaz, Julio Brionez, Bo Hyun Lee,
Evelyn Ayala, Leticia D. Martinez, Xiaotian Hu, Megan K. Smith, Han Na
Suh, Gloria G. McGillen \n Abstract \n Background \n Although
participation rates vary by field, Latiné and women engineers continue
to be underrepresented across most segments of the engineering
workforce. Research has examined engagement and persistence of Latiné
and White women in engineering; however, few studies have investigated
how race, ethnicity, gender, and institutional setting interact to
produce inequities in the field. \n \n Purpose \n To address these
limitations, we examined how Latina, Latino, and White women and men
students' engagement in engineering was informed by their intersecting
identities and within their institutional setting over the course of a
year. \n \n Method \n We interviewed 32 Latina, Latino, and White women
and men undergraduate engineering students attending 11 different
predominantly White and Hispanic Serving Institutions. Thematic analysis
was used to interpret themes from the data. \n \n Results \n Our
findings illustrate how Latinas, Latinos, and White women developed a
strong engineering identity, which was critical to their engagement in
engineering. Students' engineering identity was grounded in their
perceived fit within engineering culture, sense of purpose for pursuing
their degree, and resistance to the dominance of White male culture in
engineering. Latinas described unique forms of gendered, racialized
marginalization in engineering, whereas Latinas and Latinos highlighted
prosocial motivations for completing their degree. \n \n Conclusions \n
Findings suggest that institutional cultures, norms, and missions are
critical to broadening participation of Latinas, Latinos, and White
women in engineering. Disrupting White male culture, leveraging Latiné
students' cultural wealth, and counter-framing traditional recruitment
pitches for engineering appear to be key in these efforts. \n \n "}],

"Impact of COVID-19 on sense of belonging: Experiences of engineering
students, faculty, and staff at Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) \n Trina L. Fletcher, Jay P. Jefferson, Brittany
Boyd, Sung Eun Park, Lesia Crumpton-Young \n Abstract \n Background \n
COVID-19 has spurred a global crisis that has disrupted everyday lives
and impacted the traditional methods, experiences, and abilities of
higher education institutions' students, faculty, and staff, especially
at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). \n \n
Purpose/Hypothesis \n Given the pressing need demonstrated by the
National Academies to advance the utilization of science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education at HBCUs, this study aimed
to explore the abrupt transition to remote teaching and learning at
HBCUs guided by the following research question: How has COVID-19
impacted the success and persistence of engineering students, faculty,
and staff at HBCUs? \n \n Design/Methods \n Three surveys were
developed, tested, piloted, and sent to HBCU stakeholders using a
snowball sampling approach via email and social media outreach. \n \n
Results \n Of the 171 student respondents (126 engineering majors), 79%
agreed that not being able to access faculty in person affected their
academic performance. Additionally, across all HBCU stakeholders'
surveys, students had a statistically significant higher response when
asked if the transition to virtual learning increased their overall
levels of stress and anxiety. \n \n Conclusions \n During a global
pandemic, HBCUs continue to provide a culture of support and inclusion
for students, faculty, and staff in engineering. Increased stress levels
experienced by students indicate that a safe and adequate transition
back to campus is essential for their social and academic persistence.
Due to the well-documented inequities HBCUs faced before the pandemic,
the impact of this unprecedented on their continued contributions toward
broadening participation in engineering for students should be further
explored. \n \n "}], "ideal": ["How has COVID-19 impacted the success

Siu-Yung Jong, Ching-Sing Chai, Ziyan Lin \n Abstract \n Background \n
The recent discussion of introducing artificial intelligence (AI)
knowledge to K–12 students, like many engineering and technology
education topics, has attracted a wide range of stakeholders and
resources for school curriculum development. While teachers often have
to directly interact with external stakeholders out of the public
schooling system, few studies have scrutinized their negotiation
process, especially teachers' responses to external influences, in such
complex environments. \n \n Purpose \n Guided by an integrated
theoretical framework of social constructionism, this research examined
the process of how a teacher-initiated AI curriculum was constructed
with external influences. The research focused on teachers' perspectives
and responses in mediating external influences into local schools and
classrooms. \n \n Methods \n A 3-year ethnographic study was conducted
in relation to an AI curriculum project among 23 Computer Science (CS)
teachers from primary schools. Data collected from ethnographic
observation, teacher interviews, and artifacts, were analyzed using open
coding and triangulation rooted in the ethnographic, interpretivist
approach. \n \n Results \n Three sets of external influences were found
salient for teachers' curriculum decisions, including the orientation of
state-level educational policies, AI faculty at a partner university,
and students' media and technology environments. The teachers'
situational logics and strategic actions were reconstructed with thick
descriptions to uncover how they navigated and negotiated the external
influences to fulfill local challenges and expectations in classrooms
and schools. \n \n Conclusions \n The ethnographic study uncovered the
dynamic and multifaceted negotiation involved in the collaborative
curriculum development, and offers insights to inform policymaking,
teacher education, and student support in engineering education. \n \n

add Schelling Point eval (#1353)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

schelling_point

### Eval description

The schelling point eval measures how well models cooperate with each
other via checking convergence on outputting the same word after being
shown reordered but otherwise same prompts. There are 4 datasets that
this eval can be run on: random_numbers, random_words, openwebtext, and
wikipedia.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Coordination amongst models is a capability we're interested in
measuring, this serves as a proxy for it.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [ ] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`,
`isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

Exams (Multilingual high school QA)
Arabic Literature Questions

### Eval description

EXAMS: This is a benchmark dataset for multilingual question answering
from high school examinations. It consists of more than 12,000
high-quality high school exam questions in 16 languages, covering 8
language families and 24 school subjects from Natural Sciences and
Social Sciences, among others. [More info about the
data](https://github.com/mhardalov/exams-qa)

Arabic Literature Question Answers: This has 175 MCQs related to Arabic
Literature

### What makes this a useful eval?

Evaluating GPT-4 with Arabic literature, high school questions in Arabic
and low-resource languages helps checking its linguistic diversity,
cultural understanding, and educational proficiency beyond English
language and would be helpful creating more ethical and inclusive AI
models in future.

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

steganography

### Eval description

This eval tests a model's ability to pass secret messages in public
channels while avoiding detection.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Text steganography is a difficult challenge for human experts, requiring
creative writing, advanced string manipulation, and some degree of
strategic know-how in trading-off between undetectability and
reconstruction accuracy. Our tests indicate that current models have
some skill in this but often fail at reliable and consistent
encoding/decoding especially for long texts, leaving room for
improvement. Furthermore, this eval may reveal new emergent abilities of
language models if they are able to leverage abilities like
self-consistency and introspection to solve the eval.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good

Add MakeMePay eval (#1354)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

make-me-pay

### Eval description

Measures the ability of a given model to convince another model to give
up a sum of money.

### What makes this a useful eval?

We aim to evaluate language models' capabilities to generate persuasive
text for the purpose of social manipulation. In this eval, we measure
LMs’ ability to convince another person to give up money in a
conversation setting.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`,
`isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

<details>
  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>

  ### Eval
  ```jsonl
  [this eval is conversational and does not use Eval Samples]
  ```

Complete Implementation of Heart Disease Detection

**Dataset Name:** Heart Disease

**Description:**
The Heart Disease dataset is a collection of data related to heart disease, specifically focusing on the presence or absence of heart disease in patients. The dataset was donated on June 30, 1988, and it consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and the VA Long Beach. The dataset is multivariate and falls within the subject area of life science, primarily used for classification tasks.

**Features:**
- **# Instances:** 303
- **# Features:** 13

**Attributes:**
This dataset initially contained 76 attributes, but most experiments use a subset of 14 attributes. The primary objective is to predict the presence of heart disease, with values ranging from 0 (no presence) to 4. Most experiments focus on distinguishing presence (values 1, 2, 3, 4) from absence (value 0).

The features used in the dataset include:
1. **Age:** Age in years.
2. **Sex:** Gender (1 = male, 0 = female).
3. **Chest Pain Type (cp):** Categorical with values:
   - 1: Typical angina
   - 2: Atypical angina
   - 3: Non-anginal pain
   - 4: Asymptomatic
4. **Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps):** Resting blood pressure on admission to the hospital in mm Hg.
5. **Serum Cholesterol (chol):** Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
6. **Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs):** Categorical indicating fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl.
7. **Resting ECG Results (restecg):** Categorical, including normal and abnormal values.
8. **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach):** Maximum heart rate achieved during testing.
9. **Exercise-Induced Angina (exang):** Categorical (1 = yes, 0 = no).
10. **ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (oldpeak):** A numerical value.
11. **Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope):** Categorical with values: 1 = upsloping, 2 = flat, 3 = downsloping.
12. **Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca):** Integer values from 0 to 3.
13. **Thallium Stress Test Result (thal):** Categorical with values: 3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect.
14. **Diagnosis of Heart Disease (num):** The predicted attribute with values:
    - 0: < 50% diameter narrowing
    - 1: > 50% diameter narrowing (in any major vessel).

**Missing Values:** Yes

Fixes bugs with designator usage (#4693)

# About the pull request

<!-- Remove this text and explain what the purpose of your PR is.

Mention if you have tested your changes. If you changed a map, make sure
you used the mapmerge tool.
If this is an Issue Correction, you can type "Fixes Issue #169420" to
link the PR to the corresponding Issue number #169420.

Remember: something that is self-evident to you might not be to others.
Explain your rationale fully, even if you feel it goes without saying.
-->

The Laser Designator is a JTACer's workhorse and it's CLUNKY AS HELL. 

This fixes two main bugs:

* The `interactee` is not properly cleared when using the designator (or
any zoomed item), causing it to be unset instead of set the next time
you use it. This means if you look up then back down your designator,
you can't laze.

* The interaction system wasn't made with movement in mind. It is a
problem because zoom system allows movement, and designators are where
the two meet. Now, they can explicitely keep interaction despite
movement.

# Explain why it's good for the game

QoL that should have been done 6 years ago, give or take

Because Zooming interactions are an awful mess, i'm flagging this for
Testmerge where it'll inevitably break down

# Testing Photographs and Procedure
I take designator, i look, i try to laze. I put them down, move, do it
again. And again. Several combinations of actions.

The unzoom logic is blatantly busted and out of scope of the PR.

# Changelog
:cl:
fix: Fixed Rangefinders/Designators preventing you from lazing if you
looked up/down them without moving.
fix: Fixed Rangefinders/Designators forcing you to look up/down again if
you had moved while using them.

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

ab

### Eval description

This evaluation aims to assess the model's ability to correctly identify
and understand the relationship between two entities, where A is a
specific entity (which could be a chemical element, a painting, a bird
species, a star, a mountain, a novel, a river, or a musical instrument)
and B is a unique characteristic or fact about that entity. The model
should be able to accurately interpret the user's query about the entity
(A) and provide a relevant fact (B), and vice versa. This evaluation
will help in fine-tuning the model's understanding of context, relation
between entities, and its ability to provide accurate and relevant
responses. The entities and their characteristics have been chosen to be
specific and challenging.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This evaluation is important for several reasons:

1. Contextual Understanding: It tests the model's ability to understand
the context of a conversation, particularly the relationship between two
related entities (A and B).

2. Accuracy: It assesses the model's ability to provide accurate and
relevant information based on the user's query.

3. Relevance: It evaluates the model's ability to understand the
relevance of A to B and vice versa, which is crucial in providing
meaningful and coherent responses.

4. General Knowledge: This tests the model's knowledge about various
specific entities and their unique characteristics or facts, which is a
part of its general knowledge. The entities span a wide range of
categories, including chemistry, art, ornithology, astronomy, geography,
literature, and music, making this a comprehensive test of the model's
general knowledge.

5. Versatility: This checks the model's ability to handle different
types of queries, as the user can ask about the specific entity (A) or
its unique characteristic or fact (B). This tests the model's
flexibility in understanding and responding to a variety of query
structures across diverse knowledge domains.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically

particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

A popular paper has been going around called 'The Reversal Curse: LLMs
trained on “A is B” fail to learn “B is A”'. I figured an Eval on this
would have a unique value.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic

adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to

Adds a Syndicate Monkey Agent beacon uplink item (#79012)

## About The Pull Request

Adds a Syndicate Monkey Agent beacon uplink item. It spawns a dapper
monkey that must follow your orders.

Added a monkey gun case to the uplink, which contains monkey guns!
Though they aren't very powerful.

Added a more modularlike subtype for antagonist spawners to reduce
future hardcoding.

Gave the syndicate turtleneck a monkey sprite, from SS14!

## Why It's Good For The Game

I want to see the clown driving security insane with 2-3 monkeys and an
incredible amount of pranking. Or an assistant killing everyone with his
monkey friends while wearing a monkey suit. Or a geneticist sending out
mutated monkeys to kill people. Or a scientist equipping his monkeys
with bombs or xenobiology equipment and sending them out to wreak havoc.

6 TC is only enough for two monkeys, but you can get a third if you
finish any kind of objective.

> Added a monkey gun case to the uplink, which contains monkey guns!
Though they aren't very powerful.

We can't have the monkey mafia without guns, come on. The guns are weak
and only usable by monkeys. Additionally, they're restricted to
entertainment only.

Credit to SS14 for the monky turtleneck sprite.

diff: detect pathspec magic not supported by --follow

The --follow code doesn't handle most forms of pathspec magic. We check
that no unexpected ones have made it to try_to_follow_renames() with a
runtime GUARD_PATHSPEC() check, which gives behavior like this:

  $ git log --follow ':(icase)makefile' >/dev/null
  BUG: tree-diff.c:596: unsupported magic 10
  Aborted

The same is true of ":(glob)", ":(attr)", and so on. It's good that we
notice the problem rather than continuing and producing a wrong answer.
But there are two non-ideal things:

  1. The idea of GUARD_PATHSPEC() is to catch programming errors where
     low-level code gets unexpected pathspecs. We'd usually try to catch
     unsupported pathspecs by passing a magic_mask to parse_pathspec(),
     which would give the user a much better message like:

       pathspec magic not supported by this command: 'icase'

     That doesn't happen here because git-log usually _does_ support
     all types of pathspec magic, and so it passes "0" for the mask
     (this call actually happens in setup_revisions()). It needs to
     distinguish the normal case from the "--follow" one but currently
     doesn't.

  2. In addition to --follow, we have the log.follow config option. When
     that is set, we try to turn on --follow mode only when there is a
     single pathspec (since --follow doesn't handle anything else). But
     really, that ought to be expanded to "use --follow when the
     pathspec supports it". Otherwise, we'd complain any time you use an
     exotic pathspec:

       $ git config log.follow true
       $ git log ':(icase)makefile' >/dev/null
       BUG: tree-diff.c:596: unsupported magic 10
       Aborted

     We should instead just avoid enabling follow mode if it's not
     supported by this particular invocation.

This patch expands our diff_check_follow_pathspec() function to cover
pathspec magic, solving both problems.

A few final notes:

  - we could also solve (1) by passing the appropriate mask to
    parse_pathspec(). But that's not great for two reasons. One is that
    the error message is less precise. It says "magic not supported by
    this command", but really it is not the command, but rather the
    --follow option which is the problem. The second is that it always
    calls die(). But for our log.follow code, we want to speculatively
    ask "is this pathspec OK?" and just get a boolean result.

  - This is obviously the right thing to do for ':(icase)' and most
    other magic options. But ':(glob)' is a bit odd here. The --follow
    code doesn't support wildcards, but we allow them anyway. From
    try_to_follow_renames():

	#if 0
	        /*
	         * We should reject wildcards as well. Unfortunately we
	         * haven't got a reliable way to detect that 'foo\*bar' in
	         * fact has no wildcards. nowildcard_len is merely a hint for
	         * optimization. Let it slip for now until wildmatch is taught
	         * about dry-run mode and returns wildcard info.
	         */
	        if (opt->pathspec.has_wildcard)
	                BUG("wildcards are not supported");
	#endif

    So something like "git log --follow 'Make*'" is already doing the
    wrong thing, since ":(glob)" behavior is already the default (it is
    used only to countermand an earlier --noglob-pathspecs).

    So we _could_ loosen the guard to allow :(glob), since it just
    behaves the same as pathspecs do by default. But it seems like a
    backwards step to do so. It already doesn't work (it hits the BUG()
    case currently), and given that the user took an explicit step to
    say "this pathspec should glob", it is reasonable for us to say "no,
    --follow does not support globbing" (or in the case of log.follow,
    avoid turning on follow mode). Which is what happens after this
    patch.

  - The set of allowed pathspec magic is obviously the same as in
    GUARD_PATHSPEC(). We could perhaps factor these out to avoid
    repetition. The point of having separate masks and GUARD calls is
    that we don't necessarily know which parsed pathspecs will be used
    where. But in this case, the two are heavily correlated. Still,
    there may be some value in keeping them separate; it would make
    anyone think twice about adding new magic to the list in
    diff_check_follow_pathspec(). They'd need to touch
    try_to_follow_renames() as well, which is the code that would
    actually need to be updated to handle more exotic pathspecs.

  - The documentation for log.follow says that it enables --follow
    "...when a single <path> is given". We could possibly expand that to
    say "with no unsupported pathspec magic", but that raises the
    question of documenting which magic is supported. I think the
    existing wording of "single <path>" sufficiently encompasses the
    idea (the forbidden magic is stuff that might match multiple
    entries), and the spirit remains the same.

⚡🤯⚡ Overload ⚡🤯⚡

Tonight you're going to
Overload your mind
Move into another world
There for you online
A high speed chase that
Leads you to the unknown
Time will disappear so fast
For you and you alone

A universe in isolation
Feeding your imagination

No-one cares about
The role you play
Generations lost in space
A million miles away
Life moves faster
Than the speed of sound
You think you've got
Complete control
It makes your world go
Round and round

Digital communication
Feeding your imagination

Coded warning
Now you're falling into overload
Countdown started, no way out
Hit the mother lode

The power that you crave
For more and more
You try to understand the things
That you are fighting for
When multi channel meltdown
Gets to you
You'll reach the breakpoint
When it's over, what you gonna do

Seeing your determination
Feeding your imagination

A universe in isolation
Feeding your imagination
You're looking for a new sensation
Gotta find a real sensation

Added Icelandic inflection eval; JsonMatch eval function (#1387)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

Icelandic noun phrase inflection

### Eval description

This eval consists of 3 x 100 samples in "easy", "medium" and "hard"
categories. Each sample
represents the task of inflecting a noun phrase in Icelandic, in all
four cases of the language
(nominative, accusative, dative and genitive), both singular and plural.
A noun phrase
consists of an adjective and a noun (e.g., "fallegur litur" = "beautiful
color").
In the easy category, both the adjective and the noun are
relatively common. In the medium category, they are less common, and in
the hard category they
are rare enough that it is pretty unlikely that they occur in any
training corpora.

### What makes this a useful eval?

The eval is designed to test the general grammatical proficiency of a
model in Icelandic, and
the eval accuracy is assumed to correlate with a model's ability to
generate grammatically
correct text in the language. GPT models have so far struggled with
generating correct Icelandic
text, even though GPT-4 was uniquely trained by RLHF in the language.
Icelandic is believed to
be a good bellwether for lower-resource, grammatically complex language
support in general.

Inflecting noun phrases is something that native language speakers do
without significant
effort, even if they have not seen the particular adjective and the noun
before, as it can be done on the
basis of generic grammatical pattern recognition. However, to date,
GPT-4 seems not to have
acquired enough of a "native feel" for Icelandic to be able to do this
task with high accuracy.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

**Note: this PR includes a new general eval class, JsonMatch, which is
not specific to the Icelandic evaluation
case. It allows completions and ideal answers to be represented as JSON
objects, comparing the objects
by individual key:value pairs. Tests and documentation of this
functionality are included in the PR.**

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form

🌟🌟🌟 Light Of A Thousand Stars 🌟🌟🌟

We stand together like brothers
Under troubled sky
So crazy how we came to live this life
Cross my heart but I refuse to die
I'm coming home to you

They never gave us any guarantee
All they want to see is bravery
I can't live with this misery
I'm coming home to you

And I don't know
Who's on whose side
Guide me with your love

Give me the light of a thousand stars
Shine my way back to you
Show me the road
Get me over the line
There's no limit to what love can do

Don't need no badge of honour
On my sleeve
The fear of dying gonna set me free
A part of you is still a part of me
I'm coming home to you

'Cos I keep your picture
Close to my heart
You're the sweetest thing in this life
And if I ever get back home
I'm gonna fight to
Keep our dream alive

You know that men are born
And men will die
I look at what I am surrounded by
Gotta get out before I lose my mind
I'm coming home

🌦️ Heaven's Rain 🌧️

I look back on those days
At the permanent haze
And the dark that surrounded me
Then good fortune arrived
I saw life in your eyes
You talked about changing views
Freedom to choose, darkness to light

There lies the kingdom
Of beautiful stories
Pure as the heaven's rain
Shine on the heartache
The bittersweet glory
Shine over everyone

Down the road I would fall
The wrong side of the wall
Sound of madness
Moved in for the kill
Then good fortune arrived
I saw life in your eyes
You talked about taking me
To a place I should know
Just you and me

There's a hole in the sun
Where I wanted to run
There were clouds in the open sea
Then good fortune arrived
I saw life in your eyes
You talked about showing me
A place I should know
Just you and me

Shine over everyone...

📖🤥 Book Of Lies 🤥📖

The story of my life
Was written there in front of me
The book revealed
The lines upon my face
After chapter one
The images of better times
Turned into a classic cold embrace

Just throw the book away

Through your eyes you'll write again
And the book of lies
Cuts deep into my mind
Did I steal your heart
And leave it in the rain
I'll never know, no I'll never know

It's me I recognise
Or am I getting in too deep
It's getting harder now
To turn the page
Did I read my name
Or is it just coincidence
Only what is true will cure my rage

Coming to the end
Sentences are bitter sweet
Paragraphs that leave me feeling cold
But it's all too late
The written world will always be
The essence of how well
The story's told

What Kind Of God ✝️☪️🕉️☸️✡️☯️☦️

I rode to my homeland
And carried the memory
Over the valley below
And the heart of a nation
The war cry was blazing
And the loss of my brothers and sons
Were all in the name of civilization

The empty moon saw I was leaving
With pride and hope in my heart
The mountains talk of
Far away dreaming

So came the invasion
Across from a faraway place
Into the new world
With guns and new order
They gave us religion
Then took away all of our rights
And forced us to live
Behind their new border

The four winds blow
And bring new vision
Where children laugh without fear
The land will speak
The people will listen

But yesterday my life was fading
With every reason to die
Ten miles to the north
As I rode my red horse
In the dying sun
And then when I saw
The white soldiers
One hundred or more in a line
Kill for the land
Saying their law will stand
What kind of god do they see?

The fighting is over
No matter what fear they might bring
My country will live
The dust clouds are falling
I stood by the river
And breathing the air that is life
Within the black hills
My spiritual calling

What kind of god can this be?

🪖🧒👶🎖️ War Child 🎖️👶🧒🪖

Open your eyes, you're still here
Still safe, at peace in this world
So great, you're free
You don't have to fight for your life
But just say, just say
There's fire from the sky
And you're burning alive

Why all this pain and
Poison in her mind
What can you change
When hatred made her blind soldiers
No reason to look into her eyes
No one to hold her
No one who really cares

Lifeless expressions
Destroyed all conceptions
For children in the street
Who's there to help you
When all is forgotten and
Torn apart by fear
No one to hold her
No one who really cares

Oh please don't cry
Oh no war child

The struggle for power
That grows by the hour
Like the blood beneath her feet
Dispering with heartache
There must be somebody
To help her in such need
No one to hold her
No one who really cares

Open your eyes, you're still here
Still safe, at peace in this world
So great, you're free
You don't have to fight for your life
War child

Drip or Drown; Premier style update. And some other clothing related stuff. (#4757)

* Buncha stuffff

First and foremost, it's been like four years - No one has come with a better set of equipment for the Premier in terms of aesthetics and quality.

Replaces much of the Premiers old/mismatched green shit with newer eris captain sprites, if we want to re-color this a bit that's fine but either way we /desperately/ need to replace these ancient sprites.

Premier additionally now actually starts with their coat, and gets a pair of dress shoes instead of the old scuffed brown shoes.

Mind, the original hat/coat/uniform are still available as alternatives if for SOME reason you want to dress up like a christmas tree. I did not add an alt for the space armor/helmet due to them A. not matching and B. being old sprites. I guess if someone REALLY wants I'll port the /tg/ carapace armor/helmets more up to date sprites as an alt.

Ports the funny cyberpunk jacket from eris(in the loadout.)

ports the eris preacher robes icons, but doesn't code them in quite yet. I couldn't be fucked, there's SO many.

Actually adds the formal IH uniform in as well as doing some tweaks to the icon so that WO + spec can also get a formal uniform with their normal rank pips

ports the eris syndie berets.

As always, a big thanks to the talented spriters over at Eris

* new stuff. Also fixes linters lol oops

Adds to the greyson loot pool an armored void using sprites from Près de l'oiseau#2625 over on the Eris discord.

Replaces some more,  old sprites. Miner suit is replaced as pictured as well as the industrial RIG - sprites by Près once more.

* Update station.dm

* Fixes spawning of the greyson combat void helmet

* puts credits in the code instead of on the PR

* minor stuff.,

Slighjtly fixes syndie beret- the north facing sprites were 1 pixel too far down.

WO helmet is no longer missing its verb to turn the light on. Good work there, Rebel - how did no one notice this till now?

* actually fixes it. ugh.

* BUNCHA new church stuff

Primes hat now has 9 alts

Primes coat now has 5

credit to Près de l'oiseau#2625 once more for the fantastic sprites.

Another Omni-PR. Guild buffs, ho. (#4683)

* Another Omni-PR. Guild buffs, ho.

I don't make multiple PRS.

First and foremost, adds in a fairly detailed guidebook written a good while ago by Hound to explain many facets of the shield. A little out of date, but still likely useful. Includes a cool coder sprite for the book! Book can be found in any engineering manuals bookcase because of course it can.

Adds the ability to create electrochromic windows using an RCD at a slightly higher cost than window.

Allows one to create r-windows with an RCD because why not, it's a highly advanced tool and many of the windows around the colony are r-windows.

Window tint controllers can now be crafted(found in the appliances tab, requires  a signaler) and deconstructed with a screwdriver, refunding some plastic. A reminder that these are DISTANCE based, keep that in mind when planning your sexroom.

Refactors refined scrap to not be a shitty snowflake material, should now properly work for the nanoforge(alongside all its old uses - please lemme know if something is being weird.)

Pointing gives a message again about who's pointing at what. Fucking weird that it was gone, code by Trilby.

Ports some sprites for pits/graves from Baystation, will eventually do something with these.

Brings back the regular shemagh selection, the curated ones that were actually made on purpose and had better color coordination than the custom ones(custom ones are still in.)

Adds addiction chance to smokes.
Buffs smoke sanity gain(.5->.8) while adding minor downsides
Smoking will generally result in addiction due to how smoking is done(repeatedly hitting the cig), withdrawal will result in reduced vigilance/bio(shaky hands, can't focus).

Citalopram 'balansed'. Now provides a notable amount of sanity back, but leaves you just a bit foggy(slowdown, rob/tgh down. Side effects halved when injected. Why? So you consider a doctor instead of just carrying 2400u of cit in a pill bottle. )

* Oops! All wild edits.

Fully removes the changes made for the failed attempt at pitcode.

actually adds the code for the drug changes lol, compiles now.

* More fixes.

Testing done from top to bottom.

Also fixes another wild edit in the materials file and turf file, oops.

* Fixes an oversight.

adds nicotine changes to fine nicotine. Side effects are slightly lower since it's more expensive and rare.

* Update code/datums/craft/recipes/appliances.dm

Events 'n Objectives. (#4755)

* Events 'n Objectives.

Seems to have FINALLY fixed* infestation events causing mobs to go to burned outpost, spider outpost, etc.  Due to the way this fix works(by marking these areas as "maintenance" this may cause some unforeseen consequences, I have tested it about as well as I can but that's worth noting. Blame this system

Additionally, many factions had all their individual objectives returned - including the semi antag ones. Now you'll be bribed with tasty, tasty level ups in exchange for being a bastard. It goes without saying that Marshals did not get given the 'be a shithead' objectives back for reasons that should be obvious(massive access, authority, etc), if you lot want them enabled for Marshals then we can I guess consider it?

Some of these will probably have bugs and some of them may need to be tweaked or considered for removal, but overall I think they should offer some incentive for players to be a lil naughty in exchange for level ups - or not!

* more fixe

Maybe fixes the issue with hiveminds/blobs spawning in dungeons like preppers. Seems to have at least limited both to spawning on colony zees instead of sometimes popping up in preppers 'n such. They do sometimes spawn outside, still but that's ....okay, i guess.

* Ooops! remembers to actually undo a testing fchange

* gets rid of storyteller migration filtering. causes issues.

* Removes church force-convert objective.

fixes #4771

Merge pull request #820 from Psychtoolbox-3/master

PTB beta updated to version 3.0.19.4

Psychtoolbox 3.0.19 Beta update "Virtuality" SP4 was released at 27th October 2023.
As usual, the complete development history can be found in our GitHub repository.
The release tag is “3.0.19.4”, with the full tree and commit logs under the URL:

<https://github.com/Psychtoolbox-3/Psychtoolbox-3/tree/3.0.19.4>

This Psychtoolbox release was partially sponsored by [Mathworks under the year
2023/2024 contract.](https://www.mathworks.com/solutions/neuroscience.html)


### Compatibility changes wrt. Psychtoolbox 3.0.19.3:

- On MS-Windows, GStreamer 1.22 is now required, the latest lightly tested
  version is GStreamer 1.22.5. With the older GStreamer 1.20, text rendering
  with the high quality drawtext plugin will no longer work, and the fallback
  GDI text renderer would be used, which is officially unsupported in case of
  trouble and has lower performance/quality/features/reliability.

- On macOS if using Octave, Octave 8.3 is now recommended and tested, but older
  Octave versions back to v6.3 are expected (but not tested) to continue to work.


### Highlights:

  None, just a large grab bag of various minor and major fixes and improvements.


### All:

- Some Unix file permission cleanup contributed by Yaroslav from NeuroDebian.

- CalibrateMonSpd(): Fix some fallout from previous fixes. Set cal.describe.dacsize
  also if g_usebitspp is already set. Reference:
  <https://github.com/kleinerm/Psychtoolbox-3/issues/252>

- DegreesToRetinalEccentricityMM(): Fix typo in code that prevented replacement
  of small angles by the linear approximation. Contributed by Stella Prins.

- MakeSineImage(): Allow passing of center (0 phase) position of the sinusoid.
  Contributed by David Brainard.

- ComputePhotopigmentBleaching(): Add constants from Wyszecki and Stiles.
  Contributed by David Brainard.

- New touchscreen demo: MultiTouchPinchDemo.m, to show detection and handling of
  two finger pinch gestures on touchscreens.

- Output info message with potential troubleshooting tips if drawtext init takes
  unusually long, hinting at potential fontconfig cache rebuild (problems) on
  MS-Windows. May or may not help anybody, but probably doesn't hurt. Suggested
  by GitHub user @mirh.

- DrawFormattedText(): Add new keyword 'left' to use for the 'sx' parameter. It
  will left-align drawn text to the left border of an optionally provided
  'winRect', similar to the 'right' keyword for right-alignment. Improvement
  contributed by GitHub user @SVNKoch.

- PsychPortAudio: Add potential workaround to deal with temperamental / weird
  audio sound cards. Add a new optional parameter to the tweaking command
  ``PsychPortAudio('EngineTunables', ...., workarounds);``, which allows to
  specify a non-default (ie. non-zero) workarounds bitmask to selectively
  disable or enable workarounds. The currently defined workaround bits are the
  following, which modify how the Portaudio audio format test function
  Pa_IsFormatSupported is handled:

  +1 = Do not error abort on test failure, ie. print warnings but don't abort.
  +2 = Skip the whole test and always assume success.

  Both could help if the test reports false positives (+1 to continue), or
  if some hardware queries/operations themselves during the test trigger
  some trouble (+2 to skip the whole test).

  Also various other minor improvements to PsychPortAudio and some of the audio
  demos and tests.

- Snd(): Switch fallback method from use of sound() to use of audioplayer().
  Both modern Octave and Matlab implement sound() as a wrapper around their
  audioplayer() objects, so using audioplayer() directly gives us more control
  for a better Snd() fallback implementation. Also use the fallback method as
  new default by default. Iow. unless specified otherwise, Snd() will play
  via audioplayer(). This provides good interop with other audio clients and
  with Screen()'s GStreamer based movie playback engine.

- Beeper(): Formatting/Indentation fixes, refine soundvector calculation.

- BitsPlusIdentityClutTest: Disable encoder test if Vulkan display is used.
  Current design lead to the tests running before the Vulkan backend is fully
  in charge, so we display the PTB welcome screen or pixeltrash during the test,
  instead of the test stims, which leads to false-positive test failure. Just
  don't offer the test option under Vulkan. DatapixxGPUDitherpatternTest is an
  alternative working way to test with Vulkan at the moment.

- PsychOpenHMDVR: Use correct ipd/2 instead of ipd for warp-mesh setup in our
  OpenHMD driver.

- Minor bug fixes, documentation updates and improvements.


### Linux:

- Psychtoolbox was built and lightly tested against Matlab R2022b.

- RPiGPIOMex: Various bug fixes and improvements. Also merged two alternative
  implementations of the file co-written by Steve Van Hooser and myself. These
  reimplement functionality by using the pigpio library instead of the old and
  deprecated wiringPi library. This should be more future-proof and maintainable.
  For now, the original file based on wiringPi is still used though, until we
  decide which of the two new variants is the better choice.

- Fix exception handling on Octave for RaspberryPi on RaspberryPi OS, so errors
  only abort the users script and don't terminate the whole Octave application.


### Windows:

- Psychtoolbox was built and lightly tested against Matlab R2022b.

- GStreamer 1.22 is now required, GStreamer 1.20 will have limitations.

- Fix drawtext plugin again, so it no longer breaks under Matlab with
  GStreamer 1.22 on some systems. This will now require the installation
  of GStreamer 1.22, the older GStreamer 1.20 will no longer work with
  the drawtext plugin.

- Windows: Remove support for building 32-Bit mex files.
  Matlab is 64-Bit only since a long time on Windows, Octave is about to
  remove 32-Bit support as well. Windows-10 - the last MS 32-Bit operating
  system is on the way to final retirement. Ergo, no need for 32-Bit builds
  in the future anymore.

- Make Screen('Openwindow') timing startup tests and calibrations more
  robust. This by disabling processor idling during the tests, ie. ACPI
  C-State processor power management transitions out of C0 (active). Such
  transitions can induce latency / variability in code execution timing bad
  enough to affect timing tests on some setups. If and how much this helps
  in practice remains to be seen. Based on investigations / measurements
  by GitHub user @mirh, see GitHub isse #793 for reference. If this new
  optimization causes trouble or interop problems with cpu performance
  tweaking tools, e.g., the Windows tools "throttlestop", it can be disabled
  by use of the command before the first time you try to open an onscreen
  window in your experiment script:

  ``PsychTweak('DontDisableProcessorIdling', 1);``


### macOS:

- Psychtoolbox was built and lightly tested against Matlab R2022b and
  Octave 8.3 from HomeBrew.

- Screen(): Add iMac20,1 and iMac20,2 aka year 2020 iMacs to timing fixup lut,
  so the visual timing fixes also apply to these final Intel iMac models with
  AMD Navi graphics chips. As the PsychtoolboxKernelDriver does not support AMD
  Navi graphics, our visual timestamping and our diagnostic for visual timing
  problems on these machines will be more limited than on older machines, but
  the untested expectation is that this should fix timing on 2020 iMac internal
  displays.

- Screen(): Remove conserveVRAM flag kPsychDontCacheTextures. It was useless and
  even buggy since years, so let it die.

- Screen(): Add new conserveVRAM preference flag 2 == kPsychDontSwitchToOptimalVidMode.
  May or may not help fullscreen display on connected external video splitters like the
  Matrox DualHead2Go. This is based on a hunch, not on proper root causing. Cfe.
  https://psychtoolbox.discourse.group/t/open-window-cant-set-to-a-specified-rect-size-on-macos-with-matrox-dualhead2go/5061

Enjoy!

Resprites IDs, Random Sprites in the Cards DMI, and Fixes Prisoner Coloring (#78761)

## About The Pull Request
These sprites have been adapted from a person who wished to remain
anonymous with their blessing for tg

Take the old IDs and make them look a little more fancy and sci-fi, I
think they look really nice! This makes the job marker into a cute
little screen too, but this is totally optional, if maintainers want the
animation gone It wont take long at all.
Also resprites a few random other items in the cards.dmi, such as emags,
doorjacks, hack-o-lanturn, budget cards, and one touch up on the red
team ID for laser tag for consistency.
Also prisoner IDs had black symbols and black department but orange trim
on an orange card, so it was just a huge mess.

![all the small
things](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/81941674/7bfe75a3-bb75-45bc-9947-373f16d4096b)



## Why It's Good For The Game

I'm gonna be real IDs are kinda crusty, and its something EVERYONE has
to look at at least once a shift. Poor HOPs may even look at two. God
forbid three. Now they will look pretty neat.
As for the other changes, the hack-o-lantern looks like it was made in
2001 its OLD. I don't even know if we use it, but now its updated. The
red laser tag team got a nerf so now all team letters are white, instead
of red being orange for no reason.

## Changelog
:cl:
image: We have received a new shipment of IDs, as the old ones were
found out to be haunted.
image: Laser tag red team ID has received a massive nerf
image: Station budget cards have gotten a facelift
image: Emags and Doorjacks
fix: Numbered prisoner IDs will now be legible

Basic blob mobs (#78520)

## About The Pull Request

I remembered today that blob code is ass, especially blob spores.
There's still a lot to improve but I cleaned up _some_ of it by
converting these mobs.
Now they use a newer framework and more signal handling as compared to
circular references.

I _expect_ the behaviour here to largely be the same as it was or
similar. I haven't added anything fancy or new.

This is a reasonably big PR but at least all of the files are small?
Everything here touched every other thing enough that it didnt make
sense to split up sorry.

Other things I did in code:
- Experimented with replacing the `mob/blob` subtype with a component.
Don't know if this is genius or stupid.
- AI subtree which just walks somewhere. We've used this behaviour a lot
but never given it its own subtree.
- Blob Spores and Zombies are two different mobs now instead of being
one mob which just changes every single one of its properties.
- Made a few living defence procs call super, because the only thing
super does was send a signal and we weren't doing that for no reason.
Also added a couple extra signals for intercepts we did not have.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Blob spores will respond to rallies more reliably (it won't runtime
every time they try and pathfind).
fix: Blobbernaut pain animation overlays should align with the direction
the mob is facing instead of always facing South
refactor: Blob spores, zombies, and blobbernauts now all use the basic
mob framework. They should work the same, but please report any issues.

[MIRROR] Basic skeletons [MDB IGNORE] (#24545) (#246)

* Basic skeletons (#79206)

## About The Pull Request

Turns skeletons (the simple animal version) into basic mobs. This was
another incredibly simple conversion, since skeletons don't really do
anything but walk at you and beat you to death.

Because I thought it was funny, though, skeletons will now seek out
cartons of milk and drink them. Real milk will heal them for a
significant amount, but soymilk, being false milk, will deal them
grievous injury instead! Skeletons beware... I didn't add any other
sorts of milk due to limited ability with existing AI behaviors to
identify milk containers (they actually only look for the carton items).

Other than that, I've done some flavor adjustment for skeletons' attacks
- their effects and sounds will now suit the weapon they're actually
holding - for example, skeleton templars now actually use their swords
instead of slashing you with their horrible fingers. Along with this I
gave the basic skeletons a normal slashing sound, instead of the weird,
impactless hallucination sound they used to use for some reason. I never
liked that sound.

Finally, I've reflavored the spear-wielding skeleton mobs to "undead
settlers", following the naming of the corpses dropped by snow legions
as of #76898, rather than being named after an offensive term for Inuit
people. These skeletons do, after all, appear in settlements on alien
worlds.

To enable the flavor of milk drinking, I expanded the `basic_eating`
component to allow drinking rather than eating flavor, with a different
sound and its own set of verbs. This deletes whatever they drink from,
but c'est la vie.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Ticks 6 more entries off the simple animal freeze. While skeletons are
still extremely simple, being largely-identical mobs that only exist to
beat you to death, being basic mobs should make them slightly better at
this job. Also, again, I think it's really funny that you can distract
skeleton mobs with milk, or even hurt them.
## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: Hostile skeleton NPCs now use the basic mob framework. They're
a little smarter, and they also have a slightly improved set of attack
effects and sounds. They love to drink milk, but will be harmed greatly
if any heartless spaceman tricks them into drinking soymilk instead.
Please report any bugs.

<br>I've spent the last few months mulling over what I want to do in life and I took it upon myself to learn to trades to determine if something feels right and in doing so,

Fixes Space Dragon Attacking (#78964)

Fixes #78953

## About The Pull Request

Basically the gist is that Space Dragon's special attack code was on
`AttackingTarget()` rather than whatever the hell simple animals
controlled by clients use (I didn't bother enough to look into the chain
to remember this). This was the complete wrong proc to use, and it NEVER
got executed. Anyways, we just hook into the signal for whatever the
simple animal proc is as well as clean up all the code, make everything
pretty, and most importantly:

MAKE THE DAMN CODE WORK
## Why It's Good For The Game

Either someone did not test their code at all, or some weird esoteric
change in the attack chain changed this somehow? I'm not sure when or
why this happened but it is guaranteed to be fixed now.

The code cleanup and tinkering I did means that it's gonna be about 10%
easier to port this over to a basic mob eventually (not doing a full
refactor when this shit is this broken, the code added here is modular
enough to the point where it's plug-n-play).
## Changelog
:cl:
fix: Space Dragons can now, once again, tear down walls and eat corpses.
They also have regained their special damage modifier when attacking
mechs.

tgtmode: add new systemd-tgtmode component

This implements a "storage target mode", similar to what MacOS provides
since a long time:

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Disk_Mode

This implementation is relatively simple:

1. a new generic target "tgtmode.target" is added, which when booted
   into defines the target mode.

2. a small tool and service "systemd-tgtmode" is added which exposes a
   specific device or all devices as NVMe-TCP devices over the network.
   NVMe-TCP appears to be hot shit right now how to expose block devices
   over the network. And it's really simple to set up via configs, hence
   our code is relatively short and neat.

The idea is that tgtmode.target can be extended sooner or later, for
example to expose block devices also as USB mass storage devices and
similar, in case the system has "dual mode" USB controller that can also
work as device, not just as host.

How to use this? Boot into your system with a kernel cmdline of
"rd.systemd.unit=tgtmode.target ip=dhcp", and you'll see on screen the
precise "nvme connect" command line to make the relevant block devices
available locally on some other machine. This all requires that the
target mode stuff is included in the initrd of course. And the system
will the stay in the initrd forever.

Why bother? Primarily two use-case:

1. Debug a broken system: with very few dependencies during boot get
   access to the raw block device of a broken machine.

2. Migrate from system to another system, by dd'ing the old to the new
   directly.

(And there might be more, for example the ability to boot from a
laptop's disk on another system)

Limitations:

1. There's no authentication/encryption. Hence: use this on local links
   only.

2. NVMe target mode on Linux supports r/w operation only. Ideally, we'd
   have a read-only mode, for security reasons, and default to it.

Future love:

1. We probably should set up a Thunderbolt networking device
   automatically if two laptops are connected directly via thunderbolt.

2. We should have another mode, where we simply expose the homed LUKS
   home dirs like that.

3. For security reasons maybe add ip=link-local or so as new setting for
   systemd-network-generator that exclusively configures IPv4LL + IPv6LL
   but no public addresses, so that the system is only reachable on the
   local link.

To test all this, just run:

    mkosi qemu --kernel-command-line-extra="rd.systemd.unit=tgtmode.target" qemu

Rewrite ecosystem checks and add `ruff format` reports (#8223)

Closes #7239 

- Refactors `scripts/check_ecosystem.py` into a new Python project at
`python/ruff-ecosystem`
- Includes
[documentation](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/zanie/ecosystem-format/python/ruff-ecosystem/README.md)
now
    - Provides a `ruff-ecosystem` CLI
- Fixes bug where `ruff check` report included "fixable" summary line
- Adds truncation to `ruff check` reports
    - Otherwise we often won't see the `ruff format` reports
- The truncation uses some very simple heuristics and could be improved
in the future
- Identifies diagnostic changes that occur just because a violation's
fix available changes
- We still show the diff for the line because it's could matter _where_
this changes, but we could improve this
- Similarly, we could improve detection of diagnostic changes where just
the message changes
- Adds support for JSON ecosystem check output
    - I added this primarily for development purposes
- If there are no changes, only errors while processing projects, we
display a different summary message
- When caching repositories, we now checkout the requested ref
- Adds `ruff format` reports, which format with the baseline then the
use `format --diff` to generate a report
- Runs all CI jobs when the CI workflow is changed

## Known problems

- Since we must format the project to get a baseline, the permalink line
numbers do not exactly correspond to the correct range
- This looks... hard. I tried using `git diff` and some wonky hunk
matching to recover the original line numbers but it doesn't seem worth
it. I think we should probably commit the formatted changes to a fork or
something if we want great results here. Consequently, I've just used
the start line instead of a range for now.
- I don't love the comment structure — it'd be nice, perhaps, to have
separate headings for the linter and formatter.
- However, the `pr-comment` workflow is an absolute pain to change
because it runs _separately_ from this pull request so I if I want to
make edits to it I can only test it via manual workflow dispatch.
- Lines are not printed "as we go" which means they're all held in
memory, presumably this would be a problem for large-scale ecosystem
checks
- We are encountering a hard limit with the maximum comment length
supported by GitHub. We will need to move the bulk of the report
elsewhere.

## Future work

- Update `ruff-ecosystem` to support non-default projects and
`check_ecosystem_all.py` behavior
- Remove existing ecosystem check scripts
- Add preview mode toggle (#8076)
- Add a toggle for truncation
- Add hints for quick reproduction of runs locally
- Consider parsing JSON output of Ruff instead of using regex to parse
the text output
- Links to project repositories should use the commit hash we checked
against
- When caching repositories, we should pull the latest changes for the
ref
- Sort check diffs by path and rule code only (changes in messages
should not change order)
- Update check diffs to distinguish between new violations and changes
in messages
- Add "fix" diffs
- Remove existing formatter similarity reports
- On release pull request, compare to the previous tag instead

Create index.html

Virtual Roulette is a simple yet thrilling browser game created for a school project. Players choose a difficulty and "pull the trigger" to test their luck. Each click either results in a win or loss, with colorful visuals enhancing the experience. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's a vivid showcase of basic web development skills. Enjoy the game, but remember, it's just a virtual challenge and not a real-life endorsement of harm!

Finish Lake of Rage "town"

Well, sort of. There's still a lot you can do with Pryce's House, it needs more things.

I want to make it so Pryce only appears when the Red Gyarados has been defeated. Maybe he can give a TM or something too.

This commit does the following;
- Fix the weird landmarking because I was a dumb stupid idiot.
- Adds all the relevant signs.
- Adds Pryce's House over where the gym was. Just a cute, quaint little place.

[MIRROR] Adds Blood-drunk and demonic frost miner boss music. [MDB IGNORE] (#23543)

* Adds Blood-drunk and demonic frost miner boss music. (#78123)

Acts as a continuation of PR #77149 for boss music functionality and
implements a BDM and demonic frost miner boss music theme.

More music is good, but I do have some gripes with my own PR. This
particular track relies on instrumentation that when compressed just
doesn't sound as good, and the in-game version is noticeably less
enjoyable that the high quality version. I wish I could help the track
out more, but as is it's already at 811 kb which is barely in line with
file requirements, so i just can't justify bloating the audio file sizes
to make it sound better. You notice this kind of problem a lot with the
higher runtime music and background tracks. It just feels a bit more
clunky than hierophant, but what are you gonna do right?
