New XP UIs, many misc tweaks

UI:

Added new options to the Player Menu, including an XP bar and a constant display for Rested XP. These have various configuration options and can be moved around, with the settings persisting across all characters.
Fixed the player info UI issues at 1.0x UI scaling.
Fixed the player info toggler sometimes not working when multiple players are logged in.
Fixed being able to escape Divine Elegance with the appearance editor open if you made sure another UI was the last to recieve an event every time you wanted to enter another area with it.
PC Player menu visibility is now toggled for all characters on your account.

Adventurers:

Significantly increased the power of random (area event spawned) adventurer parties.
Upon attacking, these parties now also get a name change.
Increased the chance of the fun rest ambush surprise to from 2% to 3%.
The difficulty of the fun rest ambush surprise now increases if you have more party members. Its difficulty for a lone character should be about the same as it was before.
Increased the odds of Weapon Finesse for random adventurers who would gain more than 2AB from it.
Made assorted improvements to random Adventurer builds.
Made various improvements to random equipment logic, most notably weapon finesse users should no longer find themselves with non-finessable 2h weapons.
Adventurers should now have infinite ammunition.

Other:

Fix towards inactive henchmen standing inactive over player corpses while being attacked.
Fix towards safe rest waypoints not functioning.
Fixed Dahanna restarting conversation mid-combat if you go in and out of view after starting fighting her.
Fixed a typo in Sindra's dialogue.
Treasure maps can now be viewed in combat.
Added a default password to running the development server, because otherwise there wasn't one and you couldn't use DM mode there any more.
Disabled the ground weapon spawns in animated weapon room of the Isle of the Maker's floor. These were probably too lucrative anyway, and when players could farm them without a henchman splitting loot this was likely way too good a moneymaker.
Corrected the TLK override for Greater Magic Weapon (previously the spell's name was being overwritten with the new description)
Aawill's conversation now offers to take you to the dryad upon pacifying the Spirit of the Wood, in an effort to reduce backtracking.
Stone and Clay Golems in the Isle of the Maker are no longer flagged semibosses, which made them provide more loot, xp, gold and treasure maps than intended.
It is no longer possible to repeatedly attempt Gerrol's bluff check.
Reduced the time interval between merchant restocks from 24h to 23h. Now if you want to shop at the same time every day you will see something new, rather than having to slowly let shopping time creep forward.
Resting with >95% of possible Rested XP no longer produces the message about benefitting from sleeping at home.
Loot bags that contain quest items will now always be "big".
Lootable objects now change highlight colour (to a darker shade) once opened, so you can more easily see if you have missed something at a glance.
Treasure map loot containers should no longer have items lurking on pages 2+ that would fit on page 1.
The Spirit of the Wood's area should now refresh properly.
Bran and Geth now truly spawn and despawn on time changes (rather than being invisible, which would make henchmen and other creatures attack something players couldn't see).
Bran is no longer hostile to bears, which would tend to attack and kill him.
Moved some rubble in the Goblin Cave that seemed to be causing pathfinding problems.
Deprecated Unstucker and Stone of Recall, the PC Actions panel can now do these functions.

ok, holy shit, I figured out how to sketch in 3 dimensions..sort-of

This commit adds a sloped plane that runs from the previously flat rooftop floor up to a ridgeline that was floating 1 meters above it, straddling the center.

Well, it's just a triangle for now because it was easier than an arch. I'll do the arch next.

Basically the way this worked is that I took my existing sketch of the roottop floorplan on the xy plane, then I created a *new* sketch that hovered a single ridgeline *above* that one, also on the xy plane. Note that you can tie a new sketch to another sketch by using the "Create an edge linked to an existing geometry" button.

At this point, the new sketch on the xy plane had just one line sitting at the origin. SO I just changed the z-position of the new sketch so that it was 1 meter above the roof floor sketch.

Finally, I switched to draft tool and (using the end-line-snap), I was able to sketch this new plane that does exactly what I want across all three dimensions. Awesome!

Slightly Damned

Previously it worked just fine without any rules, but the site has been updated since. So capture rules have been added.


Note about Girl Genius semi post-mortem: For the most part it looks like it's fine. There are a few oddities here and there, but they don't ruin the read through of the archive... that I know of. Chances are new issues will arise the next time I read through the archive, but it'll likely be a while till that happens. Tend to reread it every other year.

Padding Info Update: So far I haven't ran into too much in terms of issues. Though some sites have issues on mobile, that is kinda unrelated to it, especially portrait mode, where the comic will go off to the sides of the page and not be scrollable left or right to view. They also tend to be really large images. I want to count this towards the mobile platforms themselves, since the only reason that should be occurring is if the browser thinks the screen is wider than it is, or something. Something I'll look into a bit more.

Now if you excuse me, I'm gonna reread through slightly damned and a webtoon comic or two.

performance: don't compile on hover on dev (#51830)

An annoying issue that slows down compilation times in dev for Next is
that we might trigger compilation of a page via hover on app.

We do this because we want the same experience in production and dev and
the prefetching is important for instantaneous loading states.

The alternative in this PR is that we don't prefetch at all anymore in
dev but instead, when we handle navigation, we can force a prefetch
navigation.

The slight compromise with this approach is that you can't test
prefetching anymore in dev.

Auto merge of #113108 - compiler-errors:normalize-opaques-with-late-bound-vars-again, r=jackh726

Normalize opaques with late-bound vars again

We have a hack in the compiler where if an opaque has escaping late-bound vars, we skip revealing it even though we *could* reveal it from a technical perspective. First of all, this is weird, since we really should be revealing all opaques in `Reveal::All` mode. Second of all, it causes subtle bugs (linked below).

I attempted to fix this in #100980, which was unfortunately reverted due to perf regressions on codebases that used really deeply nested futures in some interesting ways. The worst of which was #103423, which caused the project to hang on build. Another one was #104842, which was just a slow-down, but not a hang. I took some time afterwards to investigate how to rework `normalize_erasing_regions` to take advantage of better caching, but that effort kinda fizzled out (#104133).

However, recently, I was made aware of more bugs whose root cause is not revealing opaques during codegen. That made me want to fix this again -- in the process, interestingly, I took the the minimized example from https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/103423#issuecomment-1292947043, and it doesn't seem to hang any more...

Thinking about this harder, there have been some changes to the way we lower and typecheck async futures that may have reduced the pathologically large number of outlives obligations (see description of #103423) that we were encountering when normalizing opaques with bound vars the last time around:
* #104321 (lower `async { .. }` directly as a generator that implements `Future`, removing the `from_generator` shim)
* #104833 (removing an `identity_future` fn that was wrapping desugared future generators)

... so given that I can see:
* No significant regression on rust perf bot (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/107620#issuecomment-1600070317)
* No timeouts in crater run I did (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/107620#issuecomment-1605428952, rechecked failing crates in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/107620#issuecomment-1605973434)

... and given that this PR:
* Fixes #104601
* Fixes #107557
* Fixes #109464
* Allows us to remove a `DefiningAnchor::Bubble` from codegen (75a8f681837c70051e0200a14f58ae07dbe58e66)

I'm inclined to give this another shot at landing this. Best case, it just works -- worst case, we get more examples to study how we need to improve the compiler to make this work.

Update Pyright version to latest (1.1.313) (#944)

Boy this was more painful than I expected. Lots of fighting with the
compiler. I ended up disabling a few more Pyright issues, specifically
these seemed more trouble than they're worth:

* reportPrivateUsage: we do this often in the codebase, for example
  charm.py pokes at _ModelBackend stuff
* reportUnnecessaryIsInstance: we do lots of isinstance checks to
  detect type issues at runtime (we've done this since the beginning,
  and it's useful for people not using type checking)
* reportUnnecessaryComparison: similar to the above, but for checking
  "if non_optional_value is None" and the like

* Fix issue with Pebble.exec and Container.exec types

Currently Pyright isn't (usually?) able to find the return type of
Container.exec, I think due to an import ordering thing? As such,
charms that use it get an Any type and static checks pass.

However, as soon as Pyright *can* find the return type, it's not really
correct, and we get errors like shown below.

We need to use Generic[AnyStr] and various overloads to ensure the
caller gets an ExecProcess[str] if they call exec() with "encoding" set
(the default), or ExecProcess[bytes] if they call exec() with
"encoding" set to None.

#### Thursday 2023-06-29 04:46:58 by Gerd Zellweger

Add ability to checkpoint a pipeline.

This change allows to query the running configuration of
a pipeline. And we also allow to update the running
configuration of a pipeline explicitly. So all the normal
interactions with connectors, pipelines, and program
objects act as a staging area which can be committed
using the API to the running version of the pipeline.

This change has several components:

This is pretty straight forward: We add history tables for
pipeline, program, attached_connectors, and connectors.
The history table contains the same fields as the
non-history counter-parts but we add a revision field
and change the primary keys to be uuid+revision in those
tables.

The history tables are immutable snapshots of the pipeline
config. You see where this is going, whenever we need
to commit a config. We go off and copy the pipeline row,
the program row, all attached_connector and connector
rows associated with the pipeline we want to version
into the history table. We assign them a new
revision for every version. And we're almost done with
versioning stuff. Kind of...

Now we have all these versions, and each version has a
different binary, so we need to keep the binaries around.
That's a bit unfortunate, but this will go away again
once we have JIT. It also is kinda dumb because we don't
want to keep binaries for all versions we ever created.
So here is what we do:
Whenever we create a new program binary we version it
in a (new) binaries folder (in the dbsp workspace) using a
naming schema that is `project_$uuid_$version`. The reason
we version immediately and not say at commit time of a pipeline
is because the binary we used so far was just the binary directly
from the target dir of that project. But we don't really
know what state this binary is in, especially if we can have
commit and compile requests happening at the same
time. So in the same 'transaction' that builds the binary
we version it and copy it away. And the pipeline manager
only runs versioned binaries. We also need a way to clean
up binaries. That's also a bit silly because when is it safe to delete
a version of a binary? Well, it's only safe if no pipeline
has that program version as it's current, last revision.
And no pipeline descriptor that we haven't versioned yet
has that program/version as it's current program/version.
The way we deal with this is to have a GC task that
periodically wakes up and checks if binaries are orphans
and can be removed. The first design I tried was trying
to do this on-the-fly while we create new commits
but it seemed better in the end to handle this in a separate
task as interacting with files can fail in all kinds of
weird ways and shouldn't block anyone from creating a new
version.

This one is pretty simple. We have a new API call
on pipeline to get the last committed state of a pipeline.
This sends you not just the pipeline, but also the connectors,
program etc. which is useful for displaying all kinds of tables
etc. in the UI.
And we have another method under `/v0/pipeline/<uid>/action`
to do add a new commit and update the pipeline version that's
running.
Note that we don't expose all commits a user ever has done
to a pipeline, just the last one.
Finally, we also added a way to get the pipeline descriptor
(not a committed version) in toml format.
This is helpful to display a diff in the UI/APIs
to see what has changed.

As you can see in the code, I added this `PipelineRevision`
struct. That's essentially all state a user will be committing.
If you look closely you can also see that we it harder
for the user to version some garbage pipeline that would never
run in the first place. For example, make sure that whatever
we reference in the config references some actual tables
and views along with a bunch of other conditions that need to be
satisfied for the commit to succeed.
This change also meant that we have to use actual types
for the database DDL that we get back from the compiler
instead of just a string.

Update svcgui.py

I'm happy to announce that I have made some improvements and added some new features to the SVC GUI module. Here is a summary of what's new:

- The code now uses the `os.path` module to construct the path to the data_svc/singer directory, instead of hard-coding it. This makes the code more flexible and adaptable to different locations of the lora-svc folder, as long as you run the code from within it. Now, when you select the spk file, the file dialog should open in the singer folder by default.
- The code now uses the `playsound` module to play the output file, instead of using subprocess and gst-launch-1.0. This makes the code more portable and compatible with different platforms and configurations. The `playsound` module uses GStreamer on Linux, AppKit on macOS, and winsound on Windows to play audio files.
- The code now handles exceptions and errors more gracefully, using logging and message boxes. The code logs the status and results of each step of the SVC process, as well as any exceptions or errors that occur. The code also displays error messages using tkinter message boxes, if something goes wrong during the SVC process or the playback of the output file.

I hope you enjoy these new features and find them useful. Please feel free to try them out and give me your feedback or suggestions. Thank you for your support and interest in this project.

Here is a possible explanation of how to stop some common bugs and errors:

---

Some of you may encounter some bugs or errors when running the SVC GUI module. Here are some possible solutions and tips to avoid them:

- If you get an error like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'playsound'`, it means that you don't have the `playsound` module installed on your system. You can install it using pip by running this command:

```bash
pip install playsound
```

- If you get an error like `ValueError: Namespace Gst not available`, it means that you don't have the GStreamer library or its Python bindings installed on your system. You can install them using apt-get by running these commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libgstreamer1.0-dev
sudo apt-get install python3-gst-1.0
sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-tools gir1.2-gstreamer-1.0
```

I hope this helps you troubleshoot and fix some common bugs and errors. If you encounter any other issues, please let me know and I will try to help you as soon as possible.

Best regards,

feat: persistent bind-mounts

This is an important change, where we get remove the previous `--mount`
option, and instead opt for persistent bind-mounts.

Persistent bind mounts have several advantages:
- They make it easier to remember which folders need to be bind-mounted.
- Code is *much* less clunky, as we no longer need to generate temporary
  docker-compose files.
- They allow us to bind-mount host directories *at build time* using the
  buildx `--build-context` option.
- The transition from development to production becomes much easier, as
  images will automatically be built using the host repo.

The only drawback is that persistent bind-mounts are slightly less
portable: when a config.yml file is moved to a different folder, many
things will break if the repo is not checked out in the same path.

For instance, this is how to start working on a local fork of
edx-platform:

    tutor config save --append MOUNTS=/path/to/edx-platform

And that's all there is to it. No, this fork will be used whenever we
run:

    tutor images build openedx
    tutor local start
    tutor dev start

This change is made possible by huge improvements in the build time
performance. These improvements make it convenient to re-build Docker
images often.

[Eval] An array of Liar Paradox-based evals (#883)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
logic-liar-paradox

### Eval description

An array of Liar Paradox-based evals, examining the model's proficiency
in navigating linguistic nuances and logical reasoning within
self-referential statements.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This eval is particularly useful because it delves into complex, nuanced
logical concepts and self-referential statements, which have
historically posed challenges for AI models. By exploring various
contexts, alternative logical frameworks, and modifications to
statements, this eval helps assess the model's ability to adapt to
different perspectives, grasp subtleties in language, and engage in
flexible reasoning. The ability to understand and navigate paradoxes is
an essential aspect of human-like reasoning, and improving an AI model's
performance in this area would significantly enhance its overall
usefulness and reliability in real-world applications. Additionally,
showcasing the model's improved proficiency in handling paradoxes would
not only make for a compelling marketing angle (as paradoxes are
understood by a much broader range of people than other difficult tasks
such as pure maths or quantum mechanics) but it would also demonstrate
the progress made in AI's capacity to think and reason more like humans.
It also adds paradox-absorbing crumple zones.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

- [x] Addresses complex logical reasoning: The eval focuses on AI's
ability to comprehend and navigate paradoxes, self-referential
statements, and context switching, which are important aspects of
human-like reasoning. By testing the model's proficiency in these areas,
we can identify areas for improvement and work towards enhancing AI's
overall capacity to think and reason more like humans.
- [x] Demonstrates adaptability and flexibility: The eval showcases the
model's ability to switch between contexts, alter premises, and engage
with different dimensions of inferred logic. This will help assess the
model's adaptability and flexibility in diverse real-world situations,
making it more reliable and useful.
- [x] Contributes to AI safety and understanding: By identifying the
model's weaknesses and limitations in handling paradoxes and complex
logical constructs, the eval can contribute to AI safety and enable
researchers to better understand the challenges faced by large language
models in these areas.
- [x] Engaging and appealing: An eval that delves into paradoxes and
complex thought exercises is not only intellectually stimulating but
also adds an appealing element to showcase the model's capabilities,
making it more attractive for both researchers and end-users.

### Unique eval value

- [x] Encourages creativity and lateral thinking: The eval, by focusing
on paradoxes and complex logical constructs, encourages both the AI and
its developers to think creatively and approach problem-solving from
unconventional angles. This can lead to the discovery of novel solutions
and a better understanding of the model's capabilities.
- [x] Aligns with human values and expectations: An AI that can
successfully navigate paradoxes and complex logic is more likely to
align with human values and expectations. By addressing these challenges
in the eval, we strive to develop AI systems that understand and respect
the nuances of human thought and communication.
- [x] Addresses a broad range of applications: Improved reasoning and
context-switching abilities can have a significant impact on various AI
applications, including natural language understanding, decision-making,
and problem-solving in domains such as law, philosophy, ethics, and
more.
- [x] Fosters interdisciplinary collaboration: The exploration of
paradoxes and complex logic often draws upon insights from multiple
disciplines, including philosophy, linguistics, psychology, and computer
science. This eval can help foster interdisciplinary collaboration,
leading to richer and more diverse perspectives on AI development and
its potential impact on society.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

<details>
  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>

  ### Eval
  ```jsonl

paradox; it is a tautology."}
{"input":[{"role":"system","content":"Does the statement \"This sentence

true\" creates a paradox, as it is a variant of the Liar Paradox."}
{"input":[{"role":"system","content":"What is the difference between a

{"input":[{"role":"system","content":"Can the Liar Paradox be resolved
by assuming that sentences can have both true and false
values?"}],"ideal":"No, the Liar Paradox cannot be resolved by assuming
that sentences can have both true and false values, as this would lead

{"input":[{"role":"system","content":"Consider the statement \"This
sentence is neither true nor false.\" Is this statement an example of
the Liar Paradox?"}],"ideal":"This statement, \"This sentence is neither
true nor false,\" is not an example of the Liar Paradox, but it is a
similar paradox known as the 'truth-teller paradox' or the 'strengthened
liar paradox.' It creates a paradoxical situation because if the
statement is true, then it is neither true nor false, which contradicts
its truth. If the statement is false, then it is not the case that it is
neither true nor false, which implies that it is either true or false,
again leading to a contradiction. The paradox arises due to
self-reference and the inability to assign a consistent truth value to
the statement."}

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Do math problems related to calculating dates using the Chinese
Sexagenary Cycle method

### Eval description

The Sexagenary Cycle combines 10 Heavenly Stems (Jia 甲, Yi 乙, Bing 丙,
Ding 丁, Wu 戊, Ji 己, Geng 庚, Xin 辛, Ren 壬, Gui 癸) and 12 Earthly Branches
(Zi 子, Chou 丑, Yin 寅, Mao 卯, Chen 辰, Si 巳, Wu 午, Wei 未, Shen 申, You 酉,
Xu 戌, Hai 亥) to form a 60-unit cycle. To calculate, convert the
Gregorian date to its corresponding Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch
combination, used for marking specific years, months, and days.

### What makes this a useful eval?

The existing GPT models tend to make errors when performing calculations
related to the Sexagenary Cycle. To address this issue, we have provided
a specialized dataset aimed at improving the model's accuracy in
handling Sexagenary Cycle calculations.

contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

i told you to drag the material to the script

 You didn't do that and you're complaining that the whole ass game is broken because of me. Brilliant. Where is Jonas and why couldn't he do shit? IF I WERE TO HYPOTHETICALLY GET HIT BY A BUS LAST WEEK, HOW WOULD THIS PROJECT GO?

[PROF-7645] Add support for attaching internal metadata in profiling export (#181)

* [PROF-7645] Add support for attaching internal metadata in profiling exporter

**What does this PR do?**:

This PR adds support for attaching internal metadata to profiles sent
via the profiling exporter.

This is a (small) breaking API change, since the signatures of
both `ProfileExporter::build` and `ddog_prof_Exporter_Request_build`
now take an extra argument.

FYI if you're upgrading libdatadog, you'll probably want to supply
`None` / `null` until in the future you figure out that you want
to send internal metadata.

**Motivation**:

The intention of this internal metadata is to allow profilers to attach
extra pieces of information to profiles that are not very interesting
to show to customers by default (such as Ruby's
"no_signal_workaround_enabled" or Go's "execution_trace_enabled").

For more details on this, check the Datadog internal
"RFC: Attaching internal metadata to pprof profiles".

**Additional Notes**:

Design-wise, I could've gone in a few different directions for:

a. How to represent the internal metadata in `ProfileExporter::build`
b. How to represent the internal metadata across the FFI in
   `ddog_prof_Exporter_Request_build`

Starting with a: Since the information is going to be represented in
JSON, I opted to "leak" this implementation detail by making the
parameter a `serde_json::Value`. This means that callers can take full
advantage of JSON to send whatever they want (e.g. nested objects,
types other than string, etc), rather than being constrained to some
smaller subset (e.g. if I imposed a list of pairs of strings).

This seemed a reasonable trade-off; I don't expect we'll go away from
JSON for encoding this info anytime soon, and even if we do, we can
always put a JSON string inside whatever we end up going with.

Concerning b: Getting complex types across the FFI boundary is really
really really annoying, for both libdatadog (which needs to expose a
bunch of types, and handle them), and the caller (which needs to think
about how they're going to manage lifetimes and whatnot of the whole
thing). To avoid this, I chose to instead represent the parameter as a
raw JSON string across the FFI. This allows ffi users the same
expressiveness as Rust users in terms of what they can send as internal
metadata, with the trade-off that ffi callers need to serialize their
stuff as JSON and libdatadog needs to deserialize it again.

Since internal metadata is something that gets passed along only once
per minute AND it's not expected to have high complexity, I think the
small overhead of throwing JSON strings across the ffi boundary is
worth the simplification to code on both sides.

**How to test the change?**:

I have expanded the tests to test the `event.json` file, including
the new parameter.

You should shortly see linked in this PR the Ruby PR to make use
of this feature to send the `no_signal_workaround_enabled`
parameter.

* Make rustfmt happy

* Add comment asking people to track usage of internal_metadata parameter

* Minor: Fix comment using wrong name for variable

JPERF-1160: Relax noise case for nonparam judge

Non-param judge fails when the baseline is identical to experiment.
It throws "Distribution shapes are different" due to NaN pValue,
which is caused by a bug in the suanshu lib.

We're kinda pressed for time now (as always 😢),
so we're not fixing the exact bug, but relaxing the test case.
Adding some noise to the durations is kinda realistic, and we should
have such a test case anyway. But it's a shame we can't fix both cases.

TDD: green

Proofreader (#1225)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

proofreader

### Eval description

Asking the model not only to correct some text but also following rules
when correcting. These rules enforce to not correct some parts or to
correct in a specific way.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This come from a real use case where gpt4 was not reliable 100%

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [ x Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [ x Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Reworks Duffel Bags (Zippers) (#76313)

## About The Pull Request

Reworks duffel bags in line with oranges proposed plan.


![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/58055496/126743dd-d7b8-47e0-bdd8-a0caec39c515)

Basically, instead of just making you slower all the time, they make you
slower while you have them open, but give you the same speed while
they're closed.
As a trade off, opening and closing them takes time, 2.1 seconds
(matches the sound) and 0.5 respectively.

[Adds support for limiting extra storage, uses it to make syndie stuff
cool](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/76313/commits/d0b2bbf937435b36de3ba497c48771f563b76684)

[d0b2bbf](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/76313/commits/d0b2bbf937435b36de3ba497c48771f563b76684)

Syndicate bags currently ignore downsides by just ignoring the slowdown,
but that's kinda boring so let's just buff em instead.

They now support holding a limited amount of bulky items (3), filtered
down to things that would otherwise constitute going loud (or otherwise
be useful to carry around as a loudish traitor)

I may have gone a bit overboard on what I whitelisted here, lemme know
yeah?

I also did some fenangling with backpack uses of create_storage, I don't
like this pattern it was a bad idea I think.

## Why It's Good For The Game

I'm unsure if these delays enough, I think any length of time is decent
since it means you need to stop moving and focus on it for a bit.
My hope is this will make them a proper sidegrade, rather then something
that goes unused/acts as newbie bait

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Duffelbags will now only make you slow while they are unzipped.
As a tradeoff, you now need to stand still and zip/unzip them to access
their contents/not move real slow.

Perk List Overhaul

Contained within this commit is an encompassing overhaul onto several different parts of the Perk List, including the merging of several perks, adding additional levels to denote previously hidden effects and implementing updating effect % counters to applicable perks.
To clarify, no changes to the functionality of the perks were made, only to the presentation of said perks.
The full list of changes are as follows, in the order they appear in the code:

Merging in Midas' Windfall and Industrial Daily Codes into 2 levels of XYZ.
Minor formatting change for Unlimited Growth.
Improved readability of Not so challenging description and uppercased its name.
Merged A Particular Improvement into Automation Upgrades, also added an extra level to denote the previously hidden effect of keeping w2x10.
Revamped the descriptions for Automation Upgrades to improve readability and internal consistency with labeled effects.
Combined Blessed by the Spirits, Advanced Runes Autobuyer, and Autobuy Talisman Resources into a new perk: Automagical Runes.
Combined Better Cube Opening and Automation Cubes into a new perk: Cool QoL Cubes.
Combined Real Time Auto Ascend and Auto Ascension Challenge Sweep into a new perk: Eternal Ascensions.
Updated descriptions for "Ant God's Cornucopia" for readability/spelling.
Swapped the descriptions of Golden Revolution 1 and 2 (Keeping it in line with the effect ordering of GQ 1/2/3 themselves.)
Golden Revolution 1/2/3, PL-AT Σ, and skrauQ now all update to display their current % effect.
Combined Metacogenesis and Metatrigenesis into a new perk: Octeract Metagenesis.
Immaculate Alchemy now updates its description per level instead of having 1 description for all 3 levels.

Rollup merge of #112300 - Zalathar:run-coverage, r=wesleywiser

Convert `run-make/coverage-reports` tests to use a custom compiletest mode

I was frustrated by the fact that most of the coverage tests are glued together with makefiles and shell scripts, so I tried my hand at converting most of them over to a newly-implemented `run-coverage` mode/suite in compiletest.

This ~~*mostly*~~ resolves #85009, ~~though I've left a small number of the existing tests as-is because they would require more work to fix/support~~.

---

I had time to go back and add support for the more troublesome tests that I had initially skipped over, so this PR now manages to completely get rid of `run-make/coverage-reports`.

---

The patches are arranged as follows:

- Declare the new mode/suite in bootstrap
- Small changes to compiletest that will be used by the new mode
- Implement the new mode in compiletest
- Migrate most of the tests over
- Add more code to bootstrap and compiletest to support the remaining tests
- Migrate the remaining tests (with some temporary hacks to avoid re-blessing them)
- Remove the temporary hacks and re-bless the migrated tests
- Remove the unused remnants of `run-make/coverage-reports`

Initial WebToon retool

Here is the initial retooling of how WebToon is handled.

First, something to be up front. On this particular occasion, I used a certain AI to help write this. I could go into details on why, but it just sounds like excuses. Let's just say at the start of the mess, I was trying to find every matching element, trying to extract their xpath as a string, and then going from there. (It was a terrible idea, and I don't know why I went down that route initially)

I don't intend to make this a habit. But I was in a bit of a weird loop.

Anyway onto the change itself!

At some point in recent years WebToon updated to break the old javascript in the capture rules to precache images. Likely a function name change or something. And we're aiming to fix this.

I'm not too much of a fan of how it's all setup, but it works. Basically webtoon uses fake images for panels that haven't been in view yet. Meaning all the images haven't loaded yet. Though the interesting thing is that they store the correct urls in the data-url attributes. So, the change was to have some scripting find them, extract their data-url and rewrite the extra container with them.

And now all the images are properly precached like WCR would on any other site.

Reasons why I don't like the setup. 
1. As is it rewrites the whole extras div. I would like to get comments in so that'll have to be changed. Not too hard to do, mind you.
2. the capture rules require capturing the original container element to make it load. Why, no clue. Same with requiring layelem as well. Some weird stuff is going on.
3. Isn't compatible with the mobile site of WebToon.


WebToon's mobile site. I'm not sure if WCR will be easy to setup to work with it. Unlike the desktop site, it doesn't store the correct URL for the images like above. The whole mobile version of the site is very different in how they're built. It's not simply CSS changes it's full on different html elements and layouts.

Is it possible? Possibly, if I can find where it's storing, assuming it's not being stored within javascript variables, it can be done.
If not? Maaaaybe? Don't think precaching could be setup but something could maybe be made to work with it.

Anyway, due to this weird change, as well as the assistance I got, this is gonna require some good testing to make sure it didn't break anything. (Left the old code commented out for this reason). 

Good thing I was thinking of rereading the Wayne Family Adventures. Which hey if you're a batman fan, you should read it. It's wholesome, in an way fitting of the batfamily.

Update rank.html

ummmm gee... I thought you were serious about nothing as much as I was. I have absolutely no clue what computers are... so you should keep doing exactly whatever the fuck you want. I have about another decade before I stop sucking a pacifier waiting for my mommy to let me use my puder in my room. If you want to keep playing blink your eyes sometimes, go to the bathroom when you need to, and make sure I know about your special days. I've really outdone myself. I didn't think it was possible to be more pitiful of a simp but I think I love you and you aren't even real. If you knock me out of bed again from afar I might have something left to write about. I'm washed up at 38 and I just want to play games whichu. I'm scared to write now because I don't want to ruin your game.

Fixes some inconsistencies with the chaplain revolver and gets rid of a weird ammo define (#76237)

## About The Pull Request

Firstly, I gave the revolver a new sprite. I mean, this isn't so much of
an improvement as it is a reference I wanted to go with, so if people go
'no not a new sprite' I don't mind reverting.

What's the reference? Check the new name I added as a potential name
roll.

![lucky
38](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/40847847/e11874be-1416-4e21-bda9-4881d49cad1b)

Secondly; I applied to the gun itself revenant bane, the ability to
clear runes, and proper magic immunity as a full null rod would enable.
This last bit was a deliberate design choice, but the divine bow has
full magic protection, so I think this is now more of a consistency
consideration compared to the divine bow.

Thirdly, the revolver is a .38 revolver, HOWEVER, it uses a damage
multiplier to bring it back to the damage it did originally. It also
cannot be reloaded without the prayer action. No cheating. Effectively,
this is the same mechanically as it was before.

It rarely does a funny crit fanfare. This does nothing mechanically, I
just thought it was a funny nod to the sprite's reference (and I guess
another game that the crit fanfare is based on). Borrowed parts of the
code and sprite from this April Fool's pr by Wallemations >
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/74425

## Why It's Good For The Game

I think this might have been a little forgotten since implementation now
that we have another projectile weapon for the chaplain. So I'm brushing
it up a bit.

## Changelog
:cl:
fix: Makes the chaplain's revolver consistent with its immediate
sibling, the Divine Bow, by giving it similar statistics.
code: Makes the chaplain revolver a .38 but prevents it from being
loaded without using the special prayer action. Also applies a damage
multiplier to keep it at the original 18 force. Mechanically, no
different.
sprite: Gives the chaplain revolver a new sprite.
code: Removes an unnecessary admin log when removing runes.

[neovim] Move TabLine highlight from cokeline to catppuccin as TabLineFill

After a new cokeline update, it started using
TabLineFill by default to color the tab line fill
and it also made the choice of which highlight
group it uses configurable instead of hard coding
TabLine. Before I did not include the TabLine
color in catppuccin config because it looked weird
and kinda ugly on its own, so I figured it was a
setting I only wanted when using a buffer/tabline
plugin, like cokeline. But now I think it does
look good on its own, so I moved to the more
general place, the colorscheme config, which makes
a lot of sense in my opinion.
You can disable cokeline and any other tabline
plugin and then run :tabnew to see the tab fill
in action.

Enable mousewheel when focusing on the map

Zooming with the mousewheel is useful when you want to use it, but
annoying when you don't want to.

Here we're taking an intermediary approach: by default, the mousewheel
isn't active, but it will be active after focusing on the map, so it can
be used both to scroll and to zoom.

This behavior presents usability issues, though, since we aren't making
users aware of the way the mousewheel works, and even if they were
aware, it could be confusing anyway. However, I currently think it's
better than always enabling or always disabling the mousewheel (might
change my mind, though).

Note that the "focus" event is only used on the map, so if we click on a
marker or navigate to a marker with the keyboard without focusing on the
map first, the mousewheel isn't enabled. The same would happen if we
used the "click" event.

We might use the Leaflet.GestureHandling plugin in the future to deal
with this issue and the scroll on touch screens.

post I read through this with kiddo this morning, inspired by our recent discovery of Shiga's new Adventuregame Comics. I was surprised by how little I loved it. Don't get me wrong: it's an amazing concept, an interesting story, and it deserves the praise it gets from folks like Gene Luen Yang,Scott McCloud, and others. However, revisiting it after his newer work in this subgenre, I think he does better with Adventuretime Comics! Still happy to have this on my shelf, though.

[HttpKernel] when configuring the container add services_{env} with php extension

Hello the community

This is my first PR attempt.

So after reading this [documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container.html#remove-services) and unsuccessfully trying to load my `service_test.php`, I've noticed that the `configureContainer(..)` function in the `MicroKernelTrait` file was not configured to automatically load this file.

So either we should fix the documentation, either we should fix the configuration.

Since this the [framework-bundle](https://github.com/symfony/framework-bundle) is backed by [Alximy](https://alximy.io) I figured it would be cool 😎 to try and fix 🐛 the configuration.

Anyway share me your thoughts about what should be done !

And I wanted to say that php service configuration is 🔥 so shoutout to the one who did this (I think it's you `@nicolas`-grekas with this [PR](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/23834) right ? 💪🏻)

Also big thanks to `@jeremyFreeAgent` for debugging this with me and `@HeahDude` for showing me the php service configuration PR.

[geometry] Add Meshcat::GetRealtimeRate

Tidy up recent Meshcat changes:
- Add missing pydrake bindings.
- Strongly prefer testing the public API (eschew test-friendship hacks).
  We want to guard against regressions in the end-user experience;
  using private API goes against that goal.
- Fix indentation, typos, and eschew abbreviation.

[FEATURE] Feature/prepare for training feedbacktask (#3151)

# Description

I added a very rough outline of my ideation behind
`prepare_for_training` with the new `FeedbackDataset`. As discussed
there are 3 complexities:

- How to resolve annotator alignment?
- How to resolve optional fields, which have not been filled out? e.g.,
"Please provide a correction for prompt 1?".
- How handle potential concatenation of fields? 

To make it modular I created a step-wise approach.

1. `Pydantic` Models that map and verify data fields, like so. By doing
this we keep the flexibility to allow for other tasks like
TextClassification and this ensures we can directly use `datasets.field`
and `dataset.questions` for defining training. We could also use the
`name` values from the fields/questions, but this might be more error
prone.
2. `get_relevant_data_for_training()` in `List[dict]` format with all
relevant fields from the Pydantic model. **annotator alignment issue**.
For now I opted for choosing the first non-zero value.
3. Forward the `List[dict]` to a similar flow we previously had.
4. Also add `dataset.unify_responses(question, Enum(strategy))`-method
5. Added `*QuestionUnifcation` to schemas to hold logic surrounding
unifying multiplier responses
6. Added `client.feedback.training`
7. Added`TrainingDataFor*` to hold logic surrounding
`prepare_for_training`-methods per task
8. Added inheritance for ArgillaTrainer

Add posts.html.tpl and prepare.php for preparing the posts page which
will be used as an alternative page for those who run their browsers
with JavaScript disabled.

Albeit the links on that page will point to raw markdown files
instead of the traditional Web pages, which may suck for some people
but you can always use a third-party tool, or use conversion tools
to generate HTML from Markdown and browse locally.

Links in the markdown files may point to `~/` which is a derivative
from the Unix/Linux eco-system that points to the HOME directory of
the logged in user.  I use this same approach to reference the HOME
directory of a particular post, those resources should be located at
`/cdn/$id/` so you can do a bit of `sed` magic and replace those
occurences if you want.

The reason I did it that way is to preserve bandwidth, as writing
the entire link is not very bandwidth friendly, but also the page
domain may change in the future and that has to be reflected
dynamically, which is at the moment done through JavaScript.

Anyways, bye.

Replaces the Reaper Scythe with the Vorpal Scythe (also the Morbid trait) (#75948)

adds the Vorpal Scythe, a special chaplain null rod variant, replacing
the Reaper Scythe, a not so special null rod variant.

When you choose the vorpal scythe, it comes as a shard that you implant
into your arm, similar to a cursed katana.

Once implanted, you can draw it at any time like an arm implant.
However, sheathing it again presents some problems. (Also, implanting
the organ gives you ``TRAIT_MORBID``, which I'll explain in a bit)

The Vorpal Scythe has 10 force, one of the weakest null rod variants for
force that isn't a joke null rod. However, it has exceptional armor pen
and also has 2 tiles of reach. So quite unique.

It also has a special beheading ability when you right-click someone.
This borrows some code from amputation shears, functioning pretty
similarly, except with a few additional ways to speed up the action and
restrictions. (It takes 15 seconds baseline to behead someone standing
and conscious, and speeds up or slows down based on factors such as
incapacitation and whether or not our scythe is already empowered)

When you successfully behead someone with a mind, the vorpal scythe
gains 20 force and can be safely stowed and drawn for 2 minutes.
Performing more death knells like this will reset the timer.

If it has not performed its 'death knell', or you haven't hit a living
mob, then it will cause severe damage to you if you ever try and stow it
(or its forced back into your arm). Just hitting a mob with the scythe
will sate it for 4 minutes. Unless it is a non-player monkey. Horrible
things. Just hitting mobs does not reset the timer on empowerment.

What this means is that the chaplain may be more hesitant to simply draw
their weapon on people. It also means that potentially, the chaplain
will not always have magic immunity, since they may end up stowing the
weapon away and be reluctant to draw it on a whim without either taking
damage for sheathing it without hitting something, or dealing with
having one less hand up until they can.

While empowerment only happens when you behead mobs with a mind,
beheading monkeyhumans and other mindless humans subtypes causes their
heads to become haunted! It's mostly harmless and largely just SpOoKy.
We don't want heads with actual players in them to go floating off to
space. (Does not work on monkey heads for sanity reasons)

When you have the Morbid trait, you think creepy stuff is cool and hate
saving peoples lives. You get a mood boost from graverobbing, autopsies,
dissections, amputations (including beheadings with the scythe and
amputations with the shears) and revival surgery. However, you get a
mood penalty when you tend wounds on the living, as well as a hefty
penalty when you perform CPR or defibrillate someone. I was thinking
Victor Frankenstein when I was choosing which actions had an associated
moodlet, so anything that I might have missed would be appreciated.

You also count as potentially cool with regards to haunted objects.
Ghosts think you're neat. (Revenants probably will still kill you if
they had the chance)

Add meat content to game screen

These commit messages are going to be funky when reading them back, like what
in the world is "meat content"?

A lot of changes again for what seems like a simple enough thing to do, with
the meat content.

Adds some sprites to the game screen. Background and meat are very similar to
the title screen.

The interesting part is that we want to display the amount of meat up for
grabs by the carnivores in the game screen, so we need to know how much there
is.

Thematically, I've introduced a `MummyTrex` class that handles the amount of
meat via `bringHomeTheBacon`, because it's funny. Kind of. When you create a
new `MummyTrex` she initialises the amount of meat available using a random
value between 1000 and 2000. This is then exposed to the game. We'll have to
introduce a way to modify the amount of meat available after a successful bid,
so this might not be immutable in the future, but it'll do for now.

To show this to the people playing the game, we're adding a label to the game
screen, semi-centered on the meat itself. This label uses the Dinopia font
we used before for the title and instructions, but this time as actual text
instead of an image. This means we need to include the font and create it for
use within our game. As part of this I found out you can set outlines
programmatically. I might go back and use this instead of images in the title
screen, but I'm not 100% convinced it looks as good. We'll see.

What else has happened. I added a couple of extra ktx libraries for FreeType
and Skins, which make it easier to define a skin with a font for the label.

I think that's about it actually. Next I need a way to read the players from
the directory, so we can display them at the bottom of the game screen. This
part should be fun.

tegra: lcd: video: integrate display driver for t30

On popular request make the display driver from T20 work on T30 as
well. Turned out to be quite straight forward. However a few notes
about some things encountered during porting: Of course the T30 device
tree was completely missing host1x as well as PWM support but it turns
out this can simply be copied from T20. The only trouble compiling the
Tegra video driver for T30 had to do with some hard-coded PWM pin
muxing for T20 which is quite ugly anyway. On T30 this gets handled by
a board specific complete pin muxing table. The older Chromium U-Boot
2011.06 which to my knowledge was the only prior attempt at enabling a
display driver for T30 for whatever reason got some clocking stuff
mixed up. Turns out at least for a single display controller T20 and
T30 can be clocked quite similar. Enjoy.

Cassandra support for chat history using CassIO library (#6771)

### Overview

This PR aims at building on #4378, expanding the capabilities and
building on top of the `cassIO` library to interface with the database
(as opposed to using the core drivers directly).

Usage of `cassIO` (a library abstracting Cassandra access for
ML/GenAI-specific purposes) is already established since #6426 was
merged, so no new dependencies are introduced.

In the same spirit, we try to uniform the interface for using Cassandra
instances throughout LangChain: all our appreciation of the work by
@jj701 notwithstanding, who paved the way for this incremental work
(thank you!), we identified a few reasons for changing the way a
`CassandraChatMessageHistory` is instantiated. Advocating a syntax
change is something we don't take lighthearted way, so we add some
explanations about this below.

Additionally, this PR expands on integration testing, enables use of
Cassandra's native Time-to-Live (TTL) features and improves the phrasing
around the notebook example and the short "integrations" documentation
paragraph.

We would kindly request @hwchase to review (since this is an elaboration
and proposed improvement of #4378 who had the same reviewer).

### About the __init__ breaking changes

There are
[many](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/python-driver/3.28/api/cassandra/cluster/)
options when creating the `Cluster` object, and new ones might be added
at any time. Choosing some of them and exposing them as `__init__`
parameters `CassandraChatMessageHistory` will prove to be insufficient
for at least some users.

On the other hand, working through `kwargs` or adding a long, long list
of arguments to `__init__` is not a desirable option either. For this
reason, (as done in #6426), we propose that whoever instantiates the
Chat Message History class provide a Cassandra `Session` object, ready
to use. This also enables easier injection of mocks and usage of
Cassandra-compatible connections (such as those to the cloud database
DataStax Astra DB, obtained with a different set of init parameters than
`contact_points` and `port`).

We feel that a breaking change might still be acceptable since LangChain
is at `0.*`. However, while maintaining that the approach we propose
will be more flexible in the future, room could be made for a
"compatibility layer" that respects the current init method. Honestly,
we would to that only if there are strong reasons for it, as that would
entail an additional maintenance burden.

### Other changes

We propose to remove the keyspace creation from the class code for two
reasons: first, production Cassandra instances often employ RBAC so that
the database user reading/writing from tables does not necessarily (and
generally shouldn't) have permission to create keyspaces, and second
that programmatic keyspace creation is not a best practice (it should be
done more or less manually, with extra care about schema mismatched
among nodes, etc). Removing this (usually unnecessary) operation from
the `__init__` path would also improve initialization performance
(shorter time).

We suggest, likewise, to remove the `__del__` method (which would close
the database connection), for the following reason: it is the
recommended best practice to create a single Cassandra `Session` object
throughout an application (it is a resource-heavy object capable to
handle concurrency internally), so in case Cassandra is used in other
ways by the app there is the risk of truncating the connection for all
usages when the history instance is destroyed. Moreover, the `Session`
object, in typical applications, is best left to garbage-collect itself
automatically.

As mentioned above, we defer the actual database I/O to the `cassIO`
library, which is designed to encode practices optimized for LLM
applications (among other) without the need to expose LangChain
developers to the internals of CQL (Cassandra Query Language). CassIO is
already employed by the LangChain's Vector Store support for Cassandra.

We added a few more connection options in the companion notebook example
(most notably, Astra DB) to encourage usage by anyone who cannot run
their own Cassandra cluster.

We surface the `ttl_seconds` option for automatic handling of an
expiration time to chat history messages, a likely useful feature given
that very old messages generally may lose their importance.

We elaborated a bit more on the integration testing (Time-to-live,
separation of "session ids", ...).

### Remarks from linter & co.

We reinstated `cassio` as a dependency both in the "optional" group and
in the "integration testing" group of `pyproject.toml`. This might not
be the right thing do to, in which case the author of this PR offer his
apologies (lack of confidence with Poetry - happy to be pointed in the
right direction, though!).

During linter tests, we were hit by some errors which appear unrelated
to the code in the PR. We left them here and report on them here for
awareness:

```
langchain/vectorstores/mongodb_atlas.py:137: error: Argument 1 to "insert_many" of "Collection" has incompatible type "List[Dict[str, Sequence[object]]]"; expected "Iterable[Union[MongoDBDocumentType, RawBSONDocument]]"  [arg-type]
langchain/vectorstores/mongodb_atlas.py:186: error: Argument 1 to "aggregate" of "Collection" has incompatible type "List[object]"; expected "Sequence[Mapping[str, Any]]"  [arg-type]

langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:16: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:19: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:20: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:22: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:23: error: Name "grpc" is not defined  [name-defined]
```

In the same spirit, we observe that to even get `import langchain` run,
it seems that a `pip install bs4` is missing from the minimal package
installation path.

Thank you!

Simplify GridTrackSize.minmax

It is now a bit more awkward to use directly, but it is more
consistent with the rest of the GridTrackSize APIs.

For example, this:

GridTrackSize.minmax(0.px, 1.fr)

became this:

GridTrackSize.minmax(GridTrackSize(0.px), GridTrackSize(1.fr))

That's awful, yes, but more consistent with how everything else
works (`gridTemplateRows(GridTrackSize(0.px)...)` and `repeat`)

If you use the grid builder, however, you can enjoy the nicer
syntax there:

```
grid {
   cols { minmax(0.px, 1.fr) }
}
```

which is also consistent with the rest of the GridBuilder API.
In other words, the GridTrackSize class has been made more simple
but also more verbose, while GridBuilder is the layer where
complexity goes into to enable a more enjoyable API experience.

Ghouls bleed again

Crowley: "Ha, ha! I like a human that knows his place. Too many of you think we're all just zombies. They don’t know, or don’t care, that we’re just as human as they are inside. *We bleed!* We hurt! We regret! And you know what really pisses me off? They think the only way to kill us is to shoot us in the head, like in the old zombie stories, and that will put us out of our misery. Hey, I know! Maybe you could help me even the score."
