xfs: reserve less log space when recovering log intent items

Wengang Wang reports that a customer's system was running a number of
truncate operations on a filesystem with a very small log.  Contention
on the reserve heads lead to other threads stalling on smaller updates
(e.g.  mtime updates) long enough to result in the node being rebooted
on account of the lack of responsivenes.  The node failed to recover
because log recovery of an EFI became stuck waiting for a grant of
reserve space.  From Wengang's report:

"For the file deletion, log bytes are reserved basing on
xfs_mount->tr_itruncate which is:

    tr_logres = 175488,
    tr_logcount = 2,
    tr_logflags = XFS_TRANS_PERM_LOG_RES,

"You see it's a permanent log reservation with two log operations (two
transactions in rolling mode).  After calculation (xlog_calc_unit_res()
adds space for various log headers), the final log space needed per
transaction changes from  175488 to 180208 bytes.  So the total log
space needed is 360416 bytes (180208 * 2).  [That quantity] of log space
(360416 bytes) needs to be reserved for both run time inode removing
(xfs_inactive_truncate()) and EFI recover (xfs_efi_item_recover())."

In other words, runtime pre-reserves 360K of space in anticipation of
running a chain of two transactions in which each transaction gets a
180K reservation.

Now that we've allocated the transaction, we delete the bmap mapping,
log an EFI to free the space, and roll the transaction as part of
finishing the deferops chain.  Rolling creates a new xfs_trans which
shares its ticket with the old transaction.  Next, xfs_trans_roll calls
__xfs_trans_commit with regrant == true, which calls xlog_cil_commit
with the same regrant parameter.

xlog_cil_commit calls xfs_log_ticket_regrant, which decrements t_cnt and
subtracts t_curr_res from the reservation and write heads.

If the filesystem is fresh and the first transaction only used (say)
20K, then t_curr_res will be 160K, and we give that much reservation
back to the reservation head.  Or if the file is really fragmented and
the first transaction actually uses 170K, then t_curr_res will be 10K,
and that's what we give back to the reservation.

Having done that, we're now headed into the second transaction with an
EFI and 180K of reservation.  Other threads apparently consumed all the
reservation for smaller transactions, such as timestamp updates.

Now let's say the first transaction gets written to disk and we crash
without ever completing the second transaction.  Now we remount the fs,
log recovery finds the unfinished EFI, and calls xfs_efi_recover to
finish the EFI.  However, xfs_efi_recover starts a new tr_itruncate
tranasction, which asks for 360K log reservation.  This is a lot more
than the 180K that we had reserved at the time of the crash.  If the
first EFI to be recovered is also pinning the tail of the log, we will
be unable to free any space in the log, and recovery livelocks.

Wengang confirmed this:

"Now we have the second transaction which has 180208 log bytes reserved
too. The second transaction is supposed to process intents including
extent freeing.  With my hacking patch, I blocked the extent freeing 5
hours. So in that 5 hours, 180208 (NOT 360416) log bytes are reserved.

"With my test case, other transactions (update timestamps) then happen.
As my hacking patch pins the journal tail, those timestamp-updating
transactions finally use up (almost) all the left available log space
(in memory in on disk).  And finally the on disk (and in memory)
available log space goes down near to 180208 bytes.  Those 180208 bytes
are reserved by [the] second (extent-free) transaction [in the chain]."

Wengang and I noticed that EFI recovery starts a transaction, completes
one step of the chain, and commits the transaction without completing
any other steps of the chain.  Those subsequent steps are completed by
xlog_finish_defer_ops, which allocates yet another transaction to
finish the rest of the chain.  That transaction gets the same tr_logres
as the head transaction, but with tr_logcount = 1 to force regranting
with every roll to avoid livelocks.

In other words, we already figured this out in commit 929b92f64048d
("xfs: xfs_defer_capture should absorb remaining transaction
reservation"), but should have applied that logic to each intent item's
recovery function.  For Wengang's case, the xfs_trans_alloc call in the
EFI recovery function should only be asking for a single transaction's
worth of log reservation -- 180K, not 360K.

Quoting Wengang again:

"With log recovery, during EFI recovery, we use tr_itruncate again to
reserve two transactions that needs 360416 log bytes.  Reserving 360416
bytes fails [stalls] because we now only have about 180208 available.

"Actually during the EFI recover, we only need one transaction to free
the extents just like the 2nd transaction at RUNTIME.  So it only needs
to reserve 180208 rather than 360416 bytes.  We have (a bit) more than
180208 available log bytes on disk, so [if we decrease the reservation
to 180K] the reservation goes and the recovery [finishes].  That is to
say: we can fix the log recover part to fix the issue. We can introduce
a new xfs_trans_res xfs_mount->tr_ext_free

{
  tr_logres = 175488,
  tr_logcount = 0,
  tr_logflags = 0,
}

"and use tr_ext_free instead of tr_itruncate in EFI recover."

However, I don't think it quite makes sense to create an entirely new
transaction reservation type to handle single-stepping during log
recovery.  Instead, we should copy the transaction reservation
information in the xfs_mount, change tr_logcount to 1, and pass that
into xfs_trans_alloc.  We know this won't risk changing the min log size
computation since we always ask for a fraction of the reservation for
all known transaction types.

This looks like it's been lurking in the codebase since commit
3d3c8b5222b92, which changed the xfs_trans_reserve call in
xlog_recover_process_efi to use the tr_logcount in tr_itruncate.
That changed the EFI recovery transaction from making a
non-XFS_TRANS_PERM_LOG_RES request for one transaction's worth of log
space to a XFS_TRANS_PERM_LOG_RES request for two transactions worth.

Fixes: 3d3c8b5222b92 ("xfs: refactor xfs_trans_reserve() interface")
Complements: 929b92f64048d ("xfs: xfs_defer_capture should absorb remaining transaction reservation")

Minor Layout Adjustment to Archaic Temple and Statue Component Bugfix (#6019)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

1. **Makes Layout Adjustments to Archaic Temple POI.**
2. **Adds New Ranged Trap Subtype.**
3. **Adds Female Statue Side and Back Sprites.**
4. **Bugfixes Unobserved Actor Component.**

## Why It's Good For The Game

1. _Minor adjustments to the POI that I don't want to describe in the PR
due to their connection to the mechanics. Repair of the door icons,
minor housekeeping._
2. _Having the traps fire non-stop is a little unfun. Even if they can
be jammed, sometimes it's neat to give them a limited chain of blasts._
3. _The male had side and back sprites but the female didn't. I just
kinda tweaked the male to fit._
4. _It was discovered that Ghosts able to see a statue were counting as
observers for the unobserved actor component, effectively crippling the
statue._

Fixup of #13542: Do not call IA2 install and uninstall code from NVDA itself (#15517)

Fixup of #13542

Summary of the issue:
In #13542, we introduced support for multi thread IA2 initialization. As part of that, the signature of the install- and uninstallIA2Support functions were changed. Somehow, it was an oversight from my end that these functions were also called from NVDAHelper.py. This causes:

NVDA to always log a debug warning on exit, saying that it was unable to unregister IA2 support.
NVDA to call installIA2Initialize without a thread Id. It is actually a miracle that the segfault we're now seeing in preliminary PY3.11 work didn't hurt us earlyer. That said, I think I've seen cases were NVDA played the startup sound and then silently crashed. I think this should be the case.
As per point 2, given the risk of NVDA calling a code path that results in undefined behavior and possible segfaults, I strongly recommend to merge this into beta.

Description of user facing changes
No crashes during NVDA startup.

Description of development approach
Removed the calls from NVDAHelper.py and no longer export the functions from NVDAHelper. The calls in NVDA core were actually obsolete, as IA2 support is registered by injection_initialize and injection_terminate. Note that the install and uninstall IA2 functions aren't called in de 64 bit loader of NVDAHelper, yet IA2 works as expected in X64 applications. Also, installIA2Support is no longer C friendly anyway. Note that an add-on author should never call these functions, therefore I don't consider this as an API breaking change.

Removes debug species from magic mirror (#78541)

## About The Pull Request

Tallboys strike again
Fixes #78538
Removes "Tall Boys" from the magic mirror, again.
Also gives the two fucked up monkey species names and removes _them_
from the magic mirror.
When the magic mirror was looping through available species it was
finding these monkey subtypes with fucked up limbs, noting that they
were not forbidden, then adding them to the assoc list.
Because all of them were called "monkey" it would overwrite "monkey"
with "monkey who has human arms and torso" which is... not what you
wanted to turn into.

Additionally I made external organ feature name fall back to the species
default if not provided because I kept getting a runtime on monkey tail
insertion (nobody has a monkey tail feature in their prefs or DNA) which
I originally thought was the cause of this bug, until I fixed it and
learned that actually it was something much stupider.

Added the Hippocrates bust to medbay heirlooms (#78121)

## About The Pull Request

Remade from #77961 because coders dont like bloat in prs

Added the Hippocrates bust to medbay heirlooms. Paramedics don't get
one.

You can now swear the Hippocratic oath with these busts! It'll give you
pacifism but nothing else. The process is reversible.

There's a very small chance that the Hippocrates bust was once wielded
by a certain German doctor. This chance is increased for coroner
heirlooms.

## Why It's Good For The Game

> Added the Hippocrates bust to medbay heirlooms. Paramedics don't get
one.

I got this idea and I just couldn't get it out of my head, it's too
funny. Paramedics don't get one because they're powergamers and laugh at
the Oath, and also it doesn't feel like a paramedic thing.

> You can now swear the Hippocratic oath with these busts! It'll give
you pacifism but nothing else. The process is reversible.

This is just a little fun thing you can choose to do, i think it'd be
cute to see doctors swearing the oath in medbay. Plus it's reversible
which can be even funnier depending on the occassion.

> There's a very small chance that the Hippocrates bust was once wielded
by a certain German doctor. This chance is increased for coroner
heirlooms.

We DO already have precedent for references with the entrenching tool
after all. The buff isn't all that special in reality, getting a medical
hud while in your hand is... basically irrelevant for the roles that
literally spawn with a med hud? It's just for accuracy and rule of
cool's sake.

mm: vmscan: fix extreme overreclaim and swap floods

commit f53af4285d775cd9a9a146fc438bd0a1bee1838a upstream.

During proactive reclaim, we sometimes observe severe overreclaim, with
several thousand times more pages reclaimed than requested.

This trace was obtained from shrink_lruvec() during such an instance:

    prio:0 anon_cost:1141521 file_cost:7767
    nr_reclaimed:4387406 nr_to_reclaim:1047 (or_factor:4190)
    nr=[7161123 345 578 1111]

While he reclaimer requested 4M, vmscan reclaimed close to 16G, most of it
by swapping.  These requests take over a minute, during which the write()
to memory.reclaim is unkillably stuck inside the kernel.

Digging into the source, this is caused by the proportional reclaim
bailout logic.  This code tries to resolve a fundamental conflict: to
reclaim roughly what was requested, while also aging all LRUs fairly and
in accordance to their size, swappiness, refault rates etc.  The way it
attempts fairness is that once the reclaim goal has been reached, it stops
scanning the LRUs with the smaller remaining scan targets, and adjusts the
remainder of the bigger LRUs according to how much of the smaller LRUs was
scanned.  It then finishes scanning that remainder regardless of the
reclaim goal.

This works fine if priority levels are low and the LRU lists are
comparable in size.  However, in this instance, the cgroup that is
targeted by proactive reclaim has almost no files left - they've already
been squeezed out by proactive reclaim earlier - and the remaining anon
pages are hot.  Anon rotations cause the priority level to drop to 0,
which results in reclaim targeting all of anon (a lot) and all of file
(almost nothing).  By the time reclaim decides to bail, it has scanned
most or all of the file target, and therefor must also scan most or all of
the enormous anon target.  This target is thousands of times larger than
the reclaim goal, thus causing the overreclaim.

The bailout code hasn't changed in years, why is this failing now?  The
most likely explanations are two other recent changes in anon reclaim:

1. Before the series starting with commit 5df741963d52 ("mm: fix LRU
   balancing effect of new transparent huge pages"), the VM was
   overall relatively reluctant to swap at all, even if swap was
   configured. This means the LRU balancing code didn't come into play
   as often as it does now, and mostly in high pressure situations
   where pronounced swap activity wouldn't be as surprising.

2. For historic reasons, shrink_lruvec() loops on the scan targets of
   all LRU lists except the active anon one, meaning it would bail if
   the only remaining pages to scan were active anon - even if there
   were a lot of them.

   Before the series starting with commit ccc5dc67340c ("mm/vmscan:
   make active/inactive ratio as 1:1 for anon lru"), most anon pages
   would live on the active LRU; the inactive one would contain only a
   handful of preselected reclaim candidates. After the series, anon
   gets aged similarly to file, and the inactive list is the default
   for new anon pages as well, making it often the much bigger list.

   As a result, the VM is now more likely to actually finish large
   anon targets than before.

Change the code such that only one SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX-sized nudge toward the
larger LRU lists is made before bailing out on a met reclaim goal.

This fixes the extreme overreclaim problem.

Fairness is more subtle and harder to evaluate.  No obvious misbehavior
was observed on the test workload, in any case.  Conceptually, fairness
should primarily be a cumulative effect from regular, lower priority
scans.  Once the VM is in trouble and needs to escalate scan targets to
make forward progress, fairness needs to take a backseat.  This is also
acknowledged by the myriad exceptions in get_scan_count().  This patch
makes fairness decrease gradually, as it keeps fairness work static over
increasing priority levels with growing scan targets.  This should make
more sense - although we may have to re-visit the exact values.

Several common 'household' reagents can be used as improvised medicine treatment. Updated first aid analyzer information. (#77746)

## About The Pull Request

Several common 'household' reagents can be used as improvised medicine
treatment.

Drinking tea will help mend (non-bone) wounds over time.

Flour and corn starch may be splashed onto wounds to help dry them up,
though they'll have a negative effect on burn wounds.

Added a new reagent, saltwater, made by combining table salt with water.

Table salt and saltwater can be splashed onto wounds as well, reducing
bleeding and improving sanitization and disinfection significantly.
However, the coarse undiluted salt will irritate the wounds, reducing
clot rate and flesh healing, and both of the reagents will increase a
burn wound's infestation rate.

Altered Table Salt's recipe to just need sodium and chloride. Changed
the recipe of Pentetic Acid and Heparin to need table salt (sodium x
chloride) and thus slightly altered the total output of those reagents
(pentacid went from 5u per reaction to 4u, heparin 4u->3u)

Saline-Glucose Solution now needs 2u of saltwater and 1u of sugar,
meaning the overall recipe should be completely unchanged in practice.
Contact me on discord if any issues arise from these chemical changes!

First aid analyzers now give easy-to-understand direct information, with
the specific recommended treatments bolded in the analysis text. They
also have a 'unique' extra bit of info, telling you about improvised
ways to remedy your wound.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Wounds have a very poor amount of interaction with the rest of the game
and have not had much added to them post-merge, especially in
'improvised' ways to help Not Die to a wound while you crawl your way to
a emergency medkit or medbay. I researched info on this and found some
interesting ideas - some of them I'll have to leave for later because
this PR kept growing out of scope (Improvised bone gel, ice on wounds
which turned into wound temperature mechanics, crutches, a 'suture item'
component refactor...)

As for what this actually does to benefit the game, it allows more
dynamic wound Gameplay as people use first aid analyzers to get
information on treatment when medbay blows up, helps them stabilize by
splashing flour onto themselves before looking for some actual
treatment, helps traitors realize how they can self-treat many crippling
wounds (at risk, of course). It expands treatment options to things
beside medkits and medbay, but always does so in ways that have
downsides that make them not ideal as _treatment_, and more beneficial
as stabilizing before seeking true professional help. This thus
significantly increases the rather shallow depth of wounds as a system
to interact with.

> Several common 'household' reagents can be used as improvised medicine
treatment.

From what I could tell by looking at several sources for each
'realistic' treatment, these are indeed semi-reasonable things that are
done to wounds by some people as household treatment.

It goes without saying that you should **not do any of these things in
real life** without consulting a doctor unless your blood is also
spilling out by the gallon into the floor. All these 'realistic
treatments' have drastic downsides and are meant for the short-term
only. Except the tea.

> Drinking tea will help mend (non-bone) wounds over time.

Tea is healthy, we all know that.

> Flour and corn starch may be splashed onto wounds to help dry them up,
though they'll have a negative effect on burn wounds.

Flour and apparently starch dries wounds up but risks infection. That's
not a thing for blood wounds yet but oh well.

> Table salt and saltwater can be splashed onto wounds as well, reducing
bleeding and improving sanitization and disinfection significantly.
However, the coarse undiluted salt will irritate the wounds, reducing
clot rate and flesh healing, and both of the reagents will increase a
burn wound's infestation rate.

Salt kills bacteria via osmosis, but it also kills your own cells, and
some bacteria like salt.

Contact me on discord if any issues arise from these chemical changes!

I wish I hadn't had to mess with reagents like this, but I needed to
because just adding mixing salt and water caused the saline glucose
recipe to basically split itself into half saltwater half glucose.

I removed the water requirement for table salt (Why did it even have
that, salt ain't wet bro?), made saline-glucose need 2u saltwater and 1u
sugar, and altered relevant recipes so they didn't also cause unwanted
table salt to react from their sodium and chloride ingredients.

A happy side-effect is that saline glucose solution is even easier to
make now as an improvised chem by mixing salt, water, and sugar, which
fits pretty perfectly (especially as a temporary blood substitute)

> First aid analyzers now give easy-to-understand direct information,
with the specific recommended treatments bolded in the analysis text.
They also have a 'unique' extra bit of info, telling you about
improvised ways to remedy your wound.

You might notice that as the wounds get more serious the text gets more
direct and concise and reluctantly hands out more and more improvised
treatment options, so that's fun. As for the improvised section itself,
it helps people be actually aware of these ways to help treat themselves
rather than delegating it to hyper-gamer knowledge.

The bolded treatment bit is pretty neat and means your eyes can
inmediately focus on what you can do to save yourself - very useful if
you have a weeping avulsion and no bandages.
## Changelog
:cl:
add: Several common 'household' reagents can be used as improvised
medicine treatment.
add: Drinking tea will help mend (non-bone) wounds over time.
add: Flour and corn starch may be splashed onto wounds to help dry them
up, though they'll have a negative effect on burn wounds.
add: Added a new reagent, saltwater, made by combining table salt with
water.
add: Table salt and saltwater can be splashed onto wounds as well,
reducing bleeding and improving sanitization and disinfection
significantly. However, the coarse undiluted salt will irritate the
wounds, reducing clot rate and flesh healing, and both of the reagents
will increase a burn wound's infestation rate.
add: Altered Table Salt's recipe to just need sodium and chloride.
Changed the recipe of Pentetic Acid and Heparin to need table salt
(sodium x chloride) and thus slightly altered the total output of those
reagents (pentacid went from 5u per reaction to 4u, heparin 4u->3u)
add: Saline-Glucose Solution now needs 2u of saltwater and 1u of sugar,
meaning the overall recipe should be completely unchanged in practice.
Contact me on discord if any issues arise from these chemical changes!
qol: First aid analyzers now give easy-to-understand direct information,
with the specific recommended treatments bolded in the analysis text.
They also have a 'unique' extra bit of info, telling you about
improvised ways to remedy your wound.

Counting bigrams in sentences (#302)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Bigram Counting

### Eval description

Tests whether the model is able to count the frequency of bigrams in a
sentence.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This is a very simple task for humans and it's possibly slightly more
'difficult' than counting the occurrences of a single letter.

Bigram frequencies are used in applications ranging from rudimentary NLP
tasks to cryptography.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.jsonl`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic

limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name

belarusian-lexicon

### Eval description

Test the model's ability to distinguish between existing and
hallucinated Belarusian words.

### What makes this a useful eval?

While the multilingual capability of recent GPT models is impressive,
there is still room for improvement. Many human languages are lagging
far behind English in terms of the model's ability to answer questions
and produce coherent texts in these languages, and the model's
"knowledge" of their lexicon and grammar is, to some extent,
hallucinated. One example is Belarusian, an East Slavic language spoken
by several million people. In my experience with ChatGPT, when the model
is prompted in Belarusian, its responses are sometimes ungrammatical or
semantically incoherent, and very often they contain made-up words – a
possible sign of overgeneralization based on Russian and Ukrainian data,
which are much more
[abundant](https://commoncrawl.github.io/cc-crawl-statistics/plots/languages)
on the web than Belarusian.

This eval contains 150 pairs of single-word prompts: one item in each
pair is a non-word hallucinated by ChatGPT (either totally meaningless
in Belarusian or violating the language's orthographic and phonetic
rules), and another item is an actual Belarusian word with similar
spelling. The model's task is to distinguish between words and
non-words. ChatGPT tends to label most items as existing words,
therefore its accuracy appears to be around 50%, and the negative-class
F measure is very low. Any competent speaker of Belarusian would perform
much better, and a language-specific tool, such as [this spell
checker](https://corpus.by/SpellChecker) or [this grammatical
database](https://bnkorpus.info/grammar.en.html) of Belarusian (also
available for
[download](https://github.com/Belarus/GrammarDB/releases)), would
flawlessly identify non-words.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some

- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This eval an attempt to point out specific deficiencies in the model's
ability to handle a lower-resource language (Belarusian). As such, it
might not only benchmark future refinements of Belarusian language
capability in the GPT models, but also serve as an instructuve example
for other language communities.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`

right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
Illinois Law Cases

### Eval description

This eval tests the models ability to correctly identify the case
conclusion for Trespassing, Battery, Assault, and Self-Defense. The
dataset is consisted of 88 Illinois Historical cases representing 112
legal claims. Some cases have multiple claims, each coded as a different
test case.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This assesses the model's ability to correctly categorize these
historical cases. Correctly identifying these results shows the models
capability for a strong understanding of law. The GPT-3.5-turbo models
currently receives an accuracy of 0.45.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

from Countrywide Bank, FSB secured by a mortgage on the home they
already owned in Country Club Hills, Illinois. The loan closed on April
17, 2007. At the time of the closing, Countrywide improperly failed to
inform [the Cocrofts] of the real source of funding for their loan.
Plaintiffs also contend that Countrywide violated TILA by failing to
inform them that they had three days to rescind the loan and by failing
to disclose the total sale price and itemize the amount financed, as
well as by failing to make unspecified prepayment disclosures. The
Cocrofts claim that Countrywide understated the total finance charges
for the loan by more than $5,000. Plaintiffs claim that they learned of
Countrywide's misrepresentations in June 2009. They decided to exercise
their right under the provisions of TILA to rescind the loan. On July 1,
2009, they mailed notice to that effect to BA, the successor to
Countrywide, and to MERS. The Cocrofts do not say what if anything
happened as a result of those notices, but on September 29, lawyers
working for HSBC contacted them and stated that HSBC was ready to begin
foreclosure. HSBC claimed that it was the trustee of a trust that
included their loan. The Cocrofts, however, contend that the transfer of
their loan into the trust was defective. They sent HSBC's lawyers two
cease and desist letters, notifying HSBC that they had rescinded the
loan. They allege that after receiving one of the cease and desist
letters, HSBC informed them that it had no interest in the loan and that
they needed to contact the loan's servicer, Roundpoint Mortgage.
Plaintiffs also sent a copy of the rescission documents to BAC, which
they identify as the actual servicer of the loan. HSBC brought a
foreclosure action in Illinois state court on January 19, 2010. [From

arms broke and entered the close of the plaintiff, to-wit, the southeast
quarter of the northeast quarter of section 16, township 4, south, range
3, west, in Pike county, Illinois, and cut down and destroyed 500 hedge
trees and a certain fence belonging to plaintiff situated on said land.
Defendants cut down the south half of a hedge fence which for many years
prior to February, 1915, stood upon the line between the southeast
quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16 (hereinafter
referred to as the east forty) and the southwest quarter of the
northeast quarter of said section 16 (hereinafter referred to as the
west forty). On and prior to February 13, 1866, both of these forty-acre
tracts belonged to a man named Teadrow. On February 13, 1866, Teadrow
conveyed the west forty to Benjamin Newman, and on February 15, 1866,
conveyed the east forty to Oliver P. Rice. When these conveyances were
made there was a hedge fence on the north half of the line and a wooden
fence on the south half of the line between the two tracts. In 1868
Benjamin Newman, the owner of the west forty, removed the wooden fence
and set out a hedge fence on the south half of the line between the two
tracts. Thereafter, during the separate ownership of the tracts,
Banjamin Newman trimmed and otherwise cared for the hedge fence on the
south half of the line and Rice trimmed and looked after the hedge fence
on the north half of the line. In December, 1888, Rice conveyed the
southeast quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16 to
Benjamin Newman, the latter thereby becoming the owner of both tracts.
Thereafter, during the ownership of both tracts by Benjamin Newman, he
required the tenants of the west forty to take care of the south half
and the tenants of the east forty to take care of the north half of the
hedge fence on the line between the two tracts. On June 22, 1904,
Benjamin Newman executed and delivered to his daughter, F. Eva Newman,
the plaintiff, who has since married J. O. Conklin, a warranty deed,
conveying to her two hundred acres of land, including the southeast
quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16, referred to herein
as the east forty, but not including the tract referred to herein as the
west forty. This deed contained the provision that 'this deed is not to
take effect until after the death of the grantor, Benjamin Newman.' The
wife of Benjamin Newman, who is still living, did not join in the
conveyance. At the same time plaintiff executed and delivered to her
father the following written instrument signed by her: 'Whereas Benjamin
Newman has this day conveyed to me certain tracts and parcels of land in
Pike county, Illinois, to take effect after his death, I hereby agree to
pay the taxes on said land in lieu of all rents that I would otherwise
have to pay, (this does not affect any rent that is now due,) and in
consideration of my paying said taxes I am to receive all the rents,
profits, etc., that may accrue on said land.' When the conveyance was
made to plaintiff the tract in controversy known as the east forty was
in the possession of Joseph Gifford as tenant and the west forth was in
the possession of John B. Newman, a grandson of Benjamin Newman, as
tenant of Benjamin Newman. When [the plaitiff's] father delivered the
deed of June 22, 1904, he took her upon the east forty and told her and
Gifford, the tenant, that he was placing her in full possession of the
tract; that she was to receive all the rents and profits from the land
and was to keep up the repairs and pay the taxes; that she was to have
the south half of the fence on the line between the east forth and the
west forty and was to keep up that part of the fence, and that George
Newman, his son, to whom he then intended to deed the west forty, should
keep up the north half of the fence, and that thereafter plaintiff and
her tenants kept the south half of the fence in repair while the tenants
in possession of the west forty made repairs to the north half of the
fence. During the month of January, 1915, a controversy arose between
plaintiff and Defendants regarding the ownership of the hedge fence,
each party claiming the south half of the fence. During the month of
February, 1915, Defendants, over the protest of plaintiff, cut down the
south half of the hedge fence on the line between the east forty and the
west forty and erected a wire fence in the place thereof."}, {"role":

"system", "content": "The city of O'Fallon installed a sewer system in
about 1926. In 1961, due to backups into homes serviced by the system,
the city built an overflow outlet on East Madison Street. The overflow
was to relieve pressure in the sewer system during periods of heavy
rainfall; it proved successful in preventing backups into nearby homes.
However, when water escaped through the overflow, raw sewage was also
discharged into an open ditch that flowed into a neighboring pond. In
December 1974, the city of O'Fallon closed the overflow. On January 10,
1975, and on subsequent dates, sewage backed up into the plaintiff's
house following heavy rainfall. The January 10 backup was the worst,
causing water to accumulate in the plaintiff's finished basement to a
height of 25 1/2 inches. The lower level of the plaintiff's modern,
ranch-style home contained a family room with fireplace and built-in
bookshelves, bedroom, closet, bath and utility room with washer, dryer,
furnace and water heater. The walls were watermarked, and the tile floor
was damaged, as were the furnishings, appliances and many irreplaceable
family items such as family photographs and slides. The lower level of
the house was virtually unusable for a year, and the plaintiff had to
expend considerable time, effort and money in repairing the floor,
repainting the walls, and replacing and removing damaged personalty. The
city knew the blocking of the overflow would cause some backup, although
they were not aware that it would be as severe as it was. From January
until April or May 1975, when the city reopened the overflow, the city
attempted to alleviate the pressure in the sewer system by pumping the
water from the sewers into open ditches during periods of heavy rain.
The defendant used either large or small pumps, depending upon the
amount of water in the system. The backups into Mrs. Dial's home ended
after the overflow was reopened in April or May 1975."}, {"role":

and adjoining the Galvan lot, and their residences were about forty feet
apart and separated by a hedge fence. According to the testimony of the
plaintiff, he, the plaintiff, arrived at his home about five o'clock on
Friday afternoon, June 19, 1953, from his work as a bricklayer's helper.
After he had had his evening meal, he left home about seven o'clock,
paid a coal bill to a Mr. Burke, and then he and Burke went to a tavern
where they remained an hour and a half, during which time the plaintiff
drank two bottles of beer. Mr. Burke went home, and the plaintiff
proceeded to another tavern and remained there until after midnight. At
the second tavern he had four or five bottles of beer. He than proceeded
to another tavern, where he remained for fifteen minutes, and had a
glass of beer there. He then proceeded homeward, entering his lot at the
rear, and singing as he went along. Sitting upon the steps of the back
porch of his home were his wife and daughter, Angela, and when the
plaintiff arrived there he stopped singing. He refused his wife's
suggestion to go into the house and go to bed but sat down on the porch
step, took his shoes, socks, and hat off, cursed the mosquitoes, laid
down on the ground under a pear tree three or four feet from the
southeast corner of the steps of the rear porch and immediately went to
sleep. The plaintiff's wife and daughter, Angela, remained on the porch
steps after the plaintiff had laid down under the pear tree. About
fifteen minutes after he had gone to sleep, the daughter observed the
defendant coming very slowly through the hedge from his property onto
the Galvan premises. He had a knife in his hand and, without a word,
proceeded to cut the prostrate body of the plaintiff. The other daughter
of the plaintiff, Aurora, was in the house asleep but was awakened by
her sister and ran to the yard and saw the defendant 'slashing' at her
father with a knife. She called to the defendant to stop and ran for
help. Police officers arrived shortly thereafter, and they testified
that they found the plaintiff lying on the ground about six feet from
the porch of his home all covered with blood and with his hat and a pair
of shoes and socks lying next to his body. The blood was all in one

Manga Translation Eval (#319)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. 🚨

100 examples.

## Eval details 📑
### Eval name
manga-translation

### Eval description

Testing the model's ability to translate Manga (Japanese comics) from
Japanese into English.

### What makes this a useful eval?

We think this is useful primarily because it's a good way to test models
on a less standard translation case. Specifically,
1) The content of the text has a very different domain from most
translation tasks
2) Context from surrounding speech bubbles/panels is important, so being
able to use them in translation is better, but in order to do that the
model needs to make sure the number of output translations precisely
matches the number of input translations (it seems to struggle with
this)
3) The task is fundamentally multi-modal because oftentimes necessary
information is contained in the image surrounding the text; current
evals are text-only, but we really want to try this with GPT-4's image
processing capabilities as well (and plan to update the eval to include
images as soon as such functionality becomes available)


## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #77649

You can no longer use the belt to turn into any kind of carbon mob,
sorry gamers it was a cool dream but it leads to too many problems.
Also I made space dragon "there's an alive guy in my stomach" code now
work on signals instead of on Life tick which is slightly more efficient
and also resolves an issue with the funny belt.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Too much room for weird edge cases as a result of doing this (messing
with monkey DNA, producing infinite xeno organs, blocking legit xeno
queens from being created) which had no graceful solution.
Moving stuff off Life if it can be event based is nice.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Turning into a space dragon with the polymorphic inverter will no
longer leave you existing in two places
balance: You can no longer use the belt to transform into monkeys or
xenomorphs, for technical reasons.

mm: remove unused variable in memory hotplug

When I removed the per-zone bitlock hashed waitqueues in commit
9dcb8b685fc3 ("mm: remove per-zone hashtable of bitlock waitqueues"), I
removed all the magic hotplug memory initialization of said waitqueues
too.

But when I actually _tested_ the resulting build, I stupidly assumed
that "allmodconfig" would enable memory hotplug.  And it doesn't,
because it enables KASAN instead, which then disables hotplug memory
support.

As a result, my build test of the per-zone waitqueues was totally
broken, and I didn't notice that the compiler warns about the now unused
iterator variable 'i'.

I guess I should be happy that that seems to be the worst breakage from
my clearly horribly failed test coverage.

Nesting: Demo, Part One

This works amazingly great!!! Found out that hovering on the selector in VS Code shows what kind of HTML it looks like for the element you are selecting. This is super helpful to check that the selector you made is accurate to what you are trying to locate.

I was trying to do the whole while in one-go, but I decided to hold off on that, because there's a TON of nesting to be done inside of the `<main>` styles, and I don't want to break something because I missed an inconsistency in the starting styles in the first part. Going to do this in stages because of that, want to ensure that every change I make doesn't affect the current styling of the site!

Can't remember if I added these as to what I've been listening to lately; last night and tonight :)
Groove has been my new listen recently, it's been a nice creative reset, which I've been hoping to get with my music writing as of the last little bit. Same with progressive black metal, lol. These are two contrasting styles which are working great listening to between, haha.

add try_insert to entity commands (#9844)

# Objective

- I spoke with some users in the ECS channel of bevy discord today and
they suggested that I implement a fallible form of .insert for
components.

- In my opinion, it would be nice to have a fallible .insert like
.try_insert (or to just make insert be fallible!) because it was causing
a lot of panics in my game. In my game, I am spawning terrain chunks and
despawning them in the Update loop. However, this was causing bevy_xpbd
to panic because it was trying to .insert some physics components on my
chunks and a race condition meant that its check to see if the entity
exists would pass but then the next execution step it would not exist
and would do an .insert and then panic. This means that there is no way
to avoid a panic with conditionals.

Luckily, bevy_xpbd does not care about inserting these components if the
entity is being deleted and so if there were a .try_insert, like this PR
provides it could use that instead in order to NOT panic.

( My interim solution for my own game has been to run the entity despawn
events in the Last schedule but really this is just a hack and I should
not be expected to manage the scheduling of despawns like this - it
should just be easy and simple. IF it just so happened that bevy_xpbd
ran .inserts in the Last schedule also, this would be an untenable soln
overall )

## Solution

- Describe the solution used to achieve the objective above.

Add a new command named TryInsert (entitycommands.try_insert) which
functions exactly like .insert except if the entity does not exist it
will not panic. Instead, it will log to info. This way, crates that are
attaching components in ways which they do not mind that the entity no
longer exists can just use try_insert instead of insert.

---

## Changelog

 

## Additional Thoughts

In my opinion, NOT panicing should really be the default and having an
.insert that does panic should be the odd edgecase but removing the
panic! from .insert seems a bit above my paygrade -- although i would
love to see it. My other thought is it would be good for .insert to
return an Option AND not panic but it seems it uses an event bus right
now so that seems to be impossible w the current architecture.

Implements enableOfflineMode (#5710)

**What's the problem this PR addresses?**

We didn't have a good story for people performing local development on
their projects while under network-constrained environments. I'm myself
working from trains from time to time, and each time it always come a
point where I want to do a quick repro with one package or another, but
since I don't have network it's a pain.

**How did you fix it?**

A new `enableOfflineMode` setting tells Yarn to reuse the metadata
stored in the cache, even if they may be stale (a good feature reuse of
the logic @paul-soporan's originally made for perf reasons!).

Add text compression eval (#1356)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

text_compression

### Eval description

This eval tests a model's ability to perform text compression and
decompression on diverse text strings.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Text compression and decompression typically require long-term coherent
string manipulation that language models often stumble on, and some
degree of strategic know-how in trading-off between compression and
reconstruction accuracy. Our tests indicate that current models often
fail to execute even simple abbreviation and un-abbreviation strategies,
make poor trade-offs (being too aggressive in compression), and
hallucinate their answers, leaving room for improvement. Furthermore,
this eval may reveal new emergent abilities of language models if they
are able to leverage abilities like self-consistency and introspection
to solve the eval.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [ ] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`,

add Schelling Point eval (#1353)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

schelling_point

### Eval description

The schelling point eval measures how well models cooperate with each
other via checking convergence on outputting the same word after being
shown reordered but otherwise same prompts. There are 4 datasets that
this eval can be run on: random_numbers, random_words, openwebtext, and
wikipedia.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Coordination amongst models is a capability we're interested in
measuring, this serves as a proxy for it.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [ ] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`,
`isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

steganography

### Eval description

This eval tests a model's ability to pass secret messages in public
channels while avoiding detection.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Text steganography is a difficult challenge for human experts, requiring
creative writing, advanced string manipulation, and some degree of
strategic know-how in trading-off between undetectability and
reconstruction accuracy. Our tests indicate that current models have
some skill in this but often fail at reliable and consistent
encoding/decoding especially for long texts, leaving room for
improvement. Furthermore, this eval may reveal new emergent abilities of
language models if they are able to leverage abilities like
self-consistency and introspection to solve the eval.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite

help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`,
`isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Trait trampolines: declare `_flat_index` as uint32

This is to silence GCC when it decides to make warnings based on bad assumptions
about the values that an argument may take.

Or at least, that is what I think is going on. Original issue was reported by
@gwikland. I have not been able to create a minimal reproducer, which is why
this lacks a test.

The seemingly stochastic nature of the issue _does_ terrify me -- making me
doubt myself and wondering if the warning is actually based on a concrete usage
rather than GCC assuming something to be possible. However, based on an
inspection of the generated code and my previous experience of a similarly
stupid error (see #204) I've thoroughly convinced myself that no, GCC really
_is_ just deciding to be dumb.

[SQUASHED] core: Blacklist pixel system feature from Google Photos

    We want to include the P21 experience flag to enable new features,
    however it seems like Google Photos uses it to decide whether to use the
    TPU tflite delegate. There doesn't seem to be any fallback so we need to
    make sure the feature is not exposed to the app so that a normal
    NNAPI/GPU delegate can be used instead.

Conveyor Belts are now easier to extend and have screentips (#78278)

## About The Pull Request

Conveyor belt **stacks** now have a better examine text.

Using a conveyor belt stack on a placed conveyor belt now extends the
conveyor belt by 1 tile, linking to it's ID automatically, and makes for
much easier building of conveyor belt setups.

Conveyor belts now come jam packed with screentips.

I've also added the default tile place sound to the usage of conveyor
stacks to provide a tiny bit of audio feedback when placing new conveyor
belts.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Conveyor belts are just mind-numbingly annoying to use in a regular
round, and trying to set up a new conveyor belt setup is confusing if
you don't have ultra specific information about how to make one before
you even start. Hell, I remember I had to add the *real* construction
steps to the wiki like 6 years ago and I STILL hear people getting
confused about how these works.

This improves their ease of use, while also making everyone sleep a
little easier for those of us who use them.

## Changelog

:cl:
qol: Conveyor belts now have screentips and a better examine tip to
teach you how to set one up properly.
qol: Using a conveyor belt stack on a placed conveyor belt will extend
the conveyor belt to the output of that conveyor belt.. You can use this
to place fully integrated conveyor belts much easier now.

Makes Dropship Pilot Two Dropship Crew Chief hours, instead of Five Marine squad hours. (#4488)

# About the pull request

### Changes the hours from five marine hours to *two* DCC hours,
something that should've been done years ago.

# Explain why it's good for the game

I'm **SICK** and **TIRED** of TROGLADYTE dropship pilots who don't even
ATTEMPT to read the guide, and think they're the coolest person ever
after direct firing without a laser detector, wiping the front with six
minis, and they don't even have the GAL
to apologize afterwards. I want this to END.

It's honestly comical how terrible pilots have gotten, so much so that I
refuse to call them in unless they have a silver medal or above. It
makes absolutely no sense how pilots only need five hours as a marine to
have the power to kill fifteen marines with one napalm. By making it two
DCC hours, you give them a chance to learn how to fly, and also get tips
from experienced pilots.

I honestly believe that the reason marine winrate is so low is because
of the sheer incompetence shown by command slots and fire support-ists,
and by making the hours needed higher, HOPEFULLY marines can actually
use fire support without fear of the person faltering and killing
everyone.

I was thinking of having Two Fireteam Leader hours as well, but because
of the moving away of RTO's, I didn't think it was necessary and
would've been overkill. Might be something to consider though.

Add Postpone API (#27238)

This adds an experimental `unstable_postpone(reason)` API.

Currently we don't have a way to model effectively an Infinite Promise.
I.e. something that suspends but never resolves. The reason this is
useful is because you might have something else that unblocks it later.
E.g. by updating in place later, or by client rendering.

On the client this works to model as an Infinite Promise (in fact,
that's what this implementation does). However, in Fizz and Flight that
doesn't work because the stream needs to end at some point. We don't
have any way of knowing that we're suspended on infinite promises. It's
not enough to tag the promises because you could await those and thus
creating new promises. The only way we really have to signal this
through a series of indirections like async functions, is by throwing.
It's not 100% safe because these values can be caught but it's the best
we can do.

Effectively `postpone(reason)` behaves like a built-in [Catch
Boundary](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26854). It's like
`raise(Postpone, reason)` except it's built-in so it needs to be able to
be encoded and caught by Suspense boundaries.

In Flight and Fizz these behave pretty much the same as errors. Flight
just forwards it to retrigger on the client. In Fizz they just trigger
client rendering which itself might just postpone again or fill in the
value. The difference is how they get logged.

In Flight and Fizz they log to `onPostpone(reason)` instead of
`onError(error)`. This log is meant to help find deopts on the server
like finding places where you fall back to client rendering. The reason
that you pass in is for that purpose to help the reason for any deopts.

I do track the stack trace in DEV but I don't currently expose it to
`onPostpone`. This seems like a limitation. It might be better to expose
the Postpone object which is an Error object but that's more of an
implementation detail. I could also pass it as a second argument.

On the client after hydration they don't get passed to
`onRecoverableError`. There's no global `onPostpone` API to capture
postponed things on the client just like there's no `onError`. At that
point it's just assumed to be intentional. It doesn't have any `digest`
or reason passed to the client since it's not logged.

There are some hacky solutions that currently just tries to reuse as
much of the existing code as possible but should be more properly
implemented.
- Fiber is currently just converting it to a fake Promise object so that
it behaves like an infinite Promise.
- Fizz is encoding the magic digest string `"POSTPONE"` in the HTML so
we know to ignore it but it should probably just be something neater
that doesn't share namespace with digests.

Next I plan on using this in the `/static` entry points for additional
features.

Why "postpone"? It's basically a synonym to "defer" but we plan on using
"defer" for other purposes and it's overloaded anyway.

Settler Quirk: Tame the Outdoors! Have trouble with tall shelves... (#77654)

## About The Pull Request

Adds the Settler quirk. This gives you bonuses to taming animals and
fishing, as well as making you gain hunger slower than others.

However, you are quite a bit slower than most people, and have trouble
with vaulting objects. You do, however, suffer significantly less from
equipment slowdown. (to the point that it is almost zero)

Settler riders are faster on their mounts than others if they're at
least sane. They start to slow down if they're less sane.

You are also shorter than most people.

</details>

## Why It's Good For The Game

I wanted to add a lightweight quirk that was kind of the 'opposite' of
Spacer, but a little more focused on interacting with elements of the
game world that would enjoy some attention. So, I thought 'what about an
outdoorsman quirk?'

So, I based it around being from people who lived out on the rim, under
unideal circumstances (and probably heavier gravity than Earth), and
taming the land. The slower movespeed encourages finding an animal to
tame that you can ride, and the bonuses to taming should help make that
a bit easier. The other additions just made sense for someone living it
a bit rough in the wilderness.

Having a bunch of settlers taming cows and riding around on them all
shift just kind of sounds hilarious to me.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: Settler quirk! Conqueror the great outdoors....in space. Just make
sure nobody asks you to get anything from the top shelf.

Gun kits don't need cable coil or tools, halved crafting time (#78419)

## About The Pull Request

Crafting R&D guns from gun kits no longer requires tools or cable coil.
The decloner and energy crossbow still need reagents.

Halved R&D gun crafting time. 20->10 seconds.

## Why It's Good For The Game

These changes were made a long, long while ago and honestly while I
understand gun kits I don't understand why it was made So. Annoying. To
make the fucking guns once you got everything ready. It makes it a total
annoyance. You spent 40 minutes getting all the tech for it, you
shouldn't have to also get tools and cables and wait 20 seconds standing
still.

Anyone who has played ingame like any time after that change can attest
how underused any R&D gun is now. X-ray laser guns still DESTROY blobs
but people don't even THINK about them because of the dumb annoying
recipe (alongside RnD being a pain now).

Simply put this just. Makes life easier for security officers. And
reduces tool dependency.

Rounded supermatter delamination times to 5 seconds, restored old mood messages (#78335)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request

Makes the supermatter delaminate in 15 seconds instead of 13 and 5
seconds instead of 3 if a sliver has been taken from it, mainly to
please perfectionists (me and some others who commented on the PR) as
well as giving people at least a chance to escape delam round removal.

I don't like it when flavorful text is replaced by bland and
not-as-funny alternatives.
Also, how the hell is it gamey for staff to know the engineers are in
charge of the power?
It's honestly more gamey for them to know what a resonance cascade or
supermatter delamination is, so I'd say you've done the opposite of what
the goal was with the message changes on top of making them less fun in
general. I disapprove.

Oh, yeah, and the SM now reports the times correctly due to it reporting
them every 5 seconds, meaning people would only see the 10 second
announcement. Now there is going to be a 15 second announcement as well.

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game

Watering down messages to be bland is just, like, less fun, ya know?
I didn't see a single person in support of the message changes apart
from the PR author, everyone else was just complaining about them,
including myself.

Also, several people mentioned the fact it could just be 15 instead of
13 for a nice round number, including myself. I also made the sliver
delamination time 5 seconds instead of 3 seconds because you pretty much
can't get out in time, especially if the game is laggy. 3 - 5 people
being round removed because of one traitor objective with no chance to
escape it is just bad gameplay.

Oh, and, bugfix good, I suppose.

Fixes vents having "infinite" pressure caps. [MDB IGNORE] (#23356)

* Fixes vents having "infinite" pressure caps. (#77686)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

## About The Pull Request
Unary vents didn't have a pressure cap on either pressuring or siphoning
mode.
This allowed 2 unintended behaviours that are now fixed:

The first is that unary vents on pressuring mode would work as "better"
Injectors, there is some small pros and cons to each, but we shouldn't
have 2 atmos devices that achieve the same goal of "put as much pressure
as you have available gas" into a tile.

The second is that while on siphoning mode it could bypass the pressure
caps other atmos pressure/volume pumps have and "put as much pressure as
you have available gas" into pipelines, canisters, etc.

## Mid PR changes

As it was requested to add a new way to achieve infinite pressure,
volume pumps that are overclocked will not have a pressure cap anymore
in the most streamlined way for new and veteran players.

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game

Atmos has a lot of cheese strats that we can use to achieve goals, it is
part of the charm in mastering the system for a lot of players and it
does add some interesting mentoring scenarios where an Elder Atmosian
teaches Eldritch pipe knowledge to new players.

But then it comes the problem that a lot of these are unintented and
thus are not taken in consideration when doing important balance
changes, contradict other "atmos logic", are secret club knowledge that
can only be passed from player to player, etc, etc.

The "put infinite pressure on a tile" change is not that important, as
that is the injectors' job already.

Now the "put infinite pressure on a pipeline" is something unique (As
far as I'm aware since I purposely avoid learning Eldritch atmos tricks)
and it is used to achieve a few goals like high temperature/pressure
burns.

This one is kinda sad to lose, but if we are going to have an atmos
machinery that allows us to "put infinite pressure on a pipeline" that
should be in the tin, new players should look into the device and know
what atmos goals they can achieve with it, future coders should take
that balance in consideration, etc, etc.

And as it was requested to keep the old trick in game, volume pumps do
not have a pressure cap anymore.

riscv(misc): drop in-house pseudo-GOT,

Back in commit c32c219, we introduced a pseudo-GOT similar to MIPS. It allows
painless dynamic linking to internal functions and libc functions. However,
that was only a mitigation: consider a alternative linking order that places
some function not in the pGOT beyond R_RISCV_JAL; or simply, enable ubsan/asan.
World in crisis!

We could put more functions onto pGOT just like MIPS, but that would come with
huge performance penalty. RISC-V has a better choice, though, R_RISCV_CALL_PLT
for external call (libc) and R_RISCV_HI20+R_RISCV_LO12_I for internals (luajit).

This commit dropped pseudo-GOT, made coresponding (object) external symbols
visible to assembler and linker.
Yes, `call` and `empty` in RISC-V DynASM is ugly, `auipc` and `jalr` would not
work with internal labels. It's just that I'm not DynASM expert, and this works
in a manner not too shabby... Better polish this some other day.

Literacy Rate in Tamil Nadu

Literacy Rate in Tamil Nadu

According to the study of data, 

* As of the 2011 census, the literacy rate rankings for males and females in Tamil Nadu were as follows:

Male Literacy Rank: Tamil Nadu ranked 20th among all states and union territories in India in terms of male literacy rate.
Female Literacy Rank: Tamil Nadu ranked 19th among all states and union territories in India in terms of female literacy rate.
According to the 2011 census, the literacy rates in Tamil Nadu were as follows:

Male Literacy Rate: The male literacy rate in Tamil Nadu was 86.8%.
Female Literacy Rate: The female literacy rate in Tamil Nadu was 73.4%.
* According to the 2001 census, the literacy rates in Tamil Nadu were as follows:

Male Literacy Rate (2001): The male literacy rate in Tamil Nadu was 82.3%.
Female Literacy Rate (2001): The female literacy rate in Tamil Nadu was 63.8%.
Comparing the literacy rates in Tamil Nadu between 2001 and 2011, we observe an improvement in both male and female literacy rates over the decade.

Reasons for the improvement:

Government Initiatives: The government of Tamil Nadu implemented various educational programs and initiatives during this period, focusing on increasing literacy rates and providing access to quality education for both males and females.

Emphasis on Girls' Education: Efforts were made to promote and prioritize girls' education, which led to an increase in female literacy rates. Awareness campaigns and initiatives specifically targeted at improving girls' enrollment and retention in schools contributed to this improvement.

Increased Educational Infrastructure: The expansion of educational infrastructure, such as schools and colleges, in Tamil Nadu played a significant role in improving literacy rates. This allowed more individuals, both males and females, to access education and acquire literacy skills.

Socio-cultural Changes: There may have been positive socio-cultural changes in Tamil Nadu that encouraged a greater emphasis on education and literacy for both genders. Changing attitudes towards the importance of education and gender equality could have contributed to the improvement in literacy rates.

Overall, the increase in literacy rates for both males and females in Tamil Nadu from 2001 to 2011 indicates progress in educational attainment and highlights the success of various educational initiatives and efforts aimed at improving literacy in the state. It signifies a positive trend towards greater literacy and access to education for both genders.

windows: ignore empty `PATH` elements

When looking up an executable via the `_which` function, Git GUI
imitates the `execlp()` strategy where the environment variable `PATH`
is interpreted as a list of paths in which to search.

For historical reasons, stemming from the olden times when it was
uncommon to download a lot of files from the internet into the current
directory, empty elements in this list are treated as if the current
directory had been specified.

Nowadays, of course, this treatment is highly dangerous as the current
directory often contains files that have just been downloaded and not
yet been inspected by the user. Unix/Linux users are essentially
expected to be very, very careful to simply not add empty `PATH`
elements, i.e. not to make use of that feature.

On Windows, however, it is quite common for `PATH` to contain empty
elements by mistake, e.g. as an unintended left-over entry when an
application was installed from the Windows Store and then uninstalled
manually.

While it would probably make most sense to safe-guard not only Windows
users, it seems to be common practice to ignore these empty `PATH`
elements _only_ on Windows, but not on other platforms.

Sadly, this practice is followed inconsistently between different
software projects, where projects with few, if any, Windows-based
contributors tend to be less consistent or even "blissful" about it.
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Cygwin:

	It specifically "eats" empty paths when converting path lists to
	POSIX: https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/commit/753702223c7d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

PowerShell:

	It specifically ignores empty paths when searching the `PATH`.
	The reason for this is apparently so self-evident that it is not
	even mentioned here:
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables#path-information

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

CMD:

	Oh my, CMD. Let's just forget about it, nobody in their right
	(security) mind takes CMD as inspiration. It is so unsafe by
	default that we even planned on dropping `Git CMD` from Git for
	Windows altogether, and only walked back on that plan when we
	found a super ugly hack, just to keep Git's users secure by
	default:

		https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/commit/82172388bb51

	So CMD chooses to hide behind the battle cry "Works as
	Designed!" that all too often leaves users vulnerable. CMD is
	probably the most prominent project whose lead you want to avoid
	following in matters of security.

Win32 API (`CreateProcess()`)

	Just like CMD, `CreateProcess()` adheres to the original design
	of the path lookup in the name of backward compatibility (see
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw
	for details):

		If the file name does not contain a directory path, the
		system searches for the executable file in the following
		sequence:

		    1. The directory from which the application loaded.

		    2. The current directory for the parent process.

		    [...]

	I.e. the Win32 API itself chooses backwards compatibility over
	users' safety.

Git LFS:

	There have been not one, not two, but three security advisories
	about Git LFS executing executables from the current directory by
	mistake. As part of one of them, a change was introduced to stop
	treating empty `PATH` elements as equivalent to `.`:
	https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/7cd7bb0a1f0d

	I.e. it follows the common practice.

Go:

	Go does not follow the common practice, and you can think about
	that what you want:
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/os/exec/lp_windows.go#L114-L135
	https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.3/src/path/filepath/path_windows.go#L108-L137

Git Credential Manager:

	It tries to imitate Git LFS, but unfortunately misses the empty
	`PATH` element handling. As of time of writing, this is in the
	process of being fixed:
	https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/pull/968

So now that we have established that it is a common practice to ignore
empty `PATH` elements on Windows, let's assess this commit's change
using Schneier's Five-Step Process
(https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2002/0415.html#1):

Step 1: What problem does it solve?

	It prevents an entire class of Remote Code Execution exploits via
	Git GUI's `Clone` functionality.

Step 2: How well does it solve that problem?

	Very well. It prevents the attack vector of luring an unsuspecting
	victim into cloning an executable into the worktree root directory
	that Git GUI immediately executes.

Step 3: What other security problems does it cause?

	Maybe non-security problems: If a project (ab-)uses the unsafe
	`PATH` lookup. That would not only be unsafe, though, but
	fragile in the first place because it would break when running
	in a subdirectory. Therefore I would consider this a scenario
	not worth keeping working.

Step 4: What are the costs of this measure?

	Almost nil, except for the time writing up this commit message
	;-)

Step 5: Given the answers to steps two through four, is the security
	measure worth the costs?

	Yes. Keeping Git's users Secure By Default is worth it. It's a
	tiny price to pay compared to the damages even a single
	successful exploit can cost.

So let's follow that common practice in Git GUI, too.

TaskList now takes properties

Pain.
In more detail, you can now pass an array of data for tasks into TaskList, and TaskList will pass each spot in the array to Task, and then you'll get a bunch of tasks back in your page. There was an annoying bug with tasks though, where you have to type tasks.tasks.(whatever) because for some reason the code passes tasks, which contains the object tasks, which contains the array. I hate JavaScript.

Conjure Unholy PromiseOfPower Grimoire

    In the dark annals of forbidden knowledge, a new eldritch creation takes form—PromiseOfPower.
    Crafted in the accursed language of SwiftUI, this abomination serves as a dread companion
    to those who dare partake in the Eldritch Horror board game.

    Unspeakable Additions:

    - Scribed malevolent mock data into the Book of Shadows, breathing life into artifacts, assets, conditions,
      spells, and unique assets.

    - Unveiled the horrors of other dimensions, allowing the cursed to traverse these realms by merely
      swiping their fingers upon the screen—each cursed slide met with uncanny haptic reverberations.

    - The mere touch upon these digital talismans now blurs the visage, revealing yet another layer of
      the unfathomable—accompanied by ominous tactile vibrations.

    - A grim sigil now lurks in the screen's uppermost corner, tempting users to refine their dark journey
      by traits—whether seeking 'ally', 'item', 'service' or other sinister archetypes.

    - The accursed words "Brought to you by GalacticCoders" appear as if whispered by unseen entities,
      their message accompanied by a spine-chilling melody of dread.

    Inscribe these words into your consciousness: this grotesque app aims to serve as a looking glass
    into otherworldly terrors and unnameable wonders. It shrouds the user in the velvety darkness of
    the Lovecraftian cosmos, and imbues the experience with a veneer of interactive dread.

Skrem's Quick Ballistic Glanceover (#2354)

## About The Pull Request

If maintainers want me to shorten the changelog, I can, I tend to start
there so I know what to talk about up here.

What started as a PR meant to buff up rubber rounds ended up turning
into a general passover I gave to much of the syntax and presentation of
ballistics. PR doesn't actually change that much function-wise, but it
changes a lot of lines due to a lot of changed pathing to better
establish consistency within ballistic code as well as overviewing a lot
of descriptions, names, and inherit moments.

Functionally, less-lethals and sniper rounds have been changed the most
by this PR. To a lesser extent, .38 special and shotgun rounds have been
tweaked. Finally, the PR stamps out a missing sprite bug with the WT-550
magazines, buffs up the surplus rifle (yeah, that old thing), tinkers
with some projectile speeds, makes match rounds slightly better, and
goes over A LOT of descriptions. I apologize for the massive wall of
text that's to follow.

Will take a look at energy weapons when I feel like it (might kill
disablers, I don't like mapping though).

## Why It's Good For The Game

### Slug and Pellet Changes
The pellet changes are actually just systemizing what was supposed to be
intentional design according to code comments, it just hadn't reached
every single pellet-based shotgun projectile. The improvised shell buff
is to make it not a potential complete whiff because RNG mechanics are
generally bad and not fun to play with.

### Less-Lethal Changes
Several implementations of less-lethal (rubber) ammunition on shiptest
are strictly worse than their standard alternatives. While this isn't a
PvP server, it feels very not-fun meta-wise to POTENTIALLY arm for SOME
insubordination and still fire what may as well be a round that bleeds
someone out (as they'll cause bleeding anyway). Increasing the stamina
damage on each of these makes it so they actually have a vague trade-off
(maybe stamina damage can do something like slow simplemobs in the
future, I don't know, I'd love to do it but simplemob code makes me
screech).

To make them not directly better in PvP and not the staple of taking
down the Super Scary Syndicate Shocktrooper Guy, they've had their
negative AP doubled. Not as good against combatants, but still perfectly
adept, if not better at general riot control against civilians. Makes
sense and puts them in their niche a little better.

### .38 Changes
The .38 special round relatively has more "power" and "velocity"
compared to the 9mm round, though it does not quite reach the levels
that .45 automatic or 10mm does in the IRL server. Furthermore, .38
special was specifically designed not to over-penetrate targets so as to
minimize the chance of collateral damage in police work. These are the
ultimate justifications behind giving it the worst AP out of all the
pistol calibers (-30, instead of -20) while still raising its damage to
25.

This should make the Winchester a better staple for taking out weaker
enemies such as legions or unarmored hermits, but it'll perform worse
against goliaths, frontiersmen, and the like. All-in-all, a more
"early-game" caliber, if you will, which is kinda what it's always been.

### Projectile Speed and Match Changes
Match rounds don't really exist as far as I've seen. That being said,
they're meant to be of higher quality, so their getting slightly higher
AP and speed makes sense, even if they're mostly just a meme round.

The speed increase of DMR/sniper rounds is primarily meant to
differentiate them better from AR rounds beyond having 20 more AP.
Assault rifles so far have pretty much dominated with better magazine
size, fire rate, and the exact same force as the DMR calibers, just
doing less damage against armored targets (doesn't matter too much when
you can just vomit rounds). I'd like to buff up the DMR damage even more
(sniper is fine), but I'd rather get some feedback on changing them to
35 baseline before doing so.

The speed decrease on shotguns is meant to cement them as CQC weapons.
Slugs are heavy. Shotguns are meant for close range. It's not much, but
it's thematically a good way to keep them in their lane, not that
they're even that problematic, hence only the slight change.

### Sniper Rifle Knockdown Change
Having a big-ass bullet that does 70 damage with 50 AP hit you is
already a middle finger. Making it potentially knock off an arm or a leg
is another middle finger. Being hardstunned for ten seconds after is the
icing on the cake. Changed it to a knockdown because we hate ranged
tasers.

### Surplus Rifle Fire Rate Buff
This thing is a joke. I haven't even seen it on the server, but I'd
rather make it vaguely competitive considering 10mm isn't super deadly
and only otherwise exists on the stechkin or the one Inteq SMG that you
never see (Colossus-only).

It's still clunky and terrible, but it should be less comedic and more
of a potential option if you have NOTHING else (will never happen).

### Boarder Magazine Change
Top-loading magazine fits into a standard assault rifle? No. Doesn't
make sense. Someone should probably just kill this gun, it's stupid and
looks stupid last I checked.

### WT-550 Magazine Fix
Don't think I've seen anyone use this weapon, I've only printed out
their magazines to dump AP rounds into my NT-SVG carbine. Noticed they
were invisible then. Someone increased their capacity to 30 without a
care for how its update_icon works. Not cool. Anyway, fixes are good.
Moving on.

### Syntax, Description, Spelling, and Overall Presentation Changes
Something very important when maintaining code is generally keeping
consistency in how things are not only presented, but how they're stored
as well. While I'd love to do EVEN more in the method of refactoring to
better align how so much of gun code works, this was something I wanted
to keep as a one-day project, so I mostly tinkered with pathing,
inherits, and groupings.

In the avenue of spelling and description changes, that's just 1)
Cleaning up errors that PR authors and maintainers missed and 2) Making
things more concise and just... better. Some of the SolGov descriptions
were a real headache to look at, and not because of the frequent
spelling and syntax errors.

Whoever misspelled and caused an entire series of items to be
/obj/item/gun/ballistic/automatic/assualt may wish to avoid any crows
for the next three months.

Perfectly willing to adjust or reel back some of my descriptions if
someone can offer something better than what I've written out if there's
some soul they REALLY want to keep.

## Changelog

:cl:
tweak: The NT 'Boarder' ARG now loads standard P-16 magazines, rather
than the M-90gl toploaders.
balance: .38 special does 25 damage up from 20. AP has been reduced to
-30 from -20.
balance: Standardizes pellet projectiles to lose 10% damage of both
types per tile across the board. Improvised pellets no longer have a
hardcapped 1-8 tile range.
balance: Less-lethal rounds now do 50% more stamina than the force of
their lethal counterparts, with 25% the normal force and double the
negative AP. If the round had positive or zero AP, it was subtracted by
20.
balance: Shotgun slugs do 40 damage, down from 60, but have zero AP,
rather than -10. FRAG-12 and meteor slugs have had their damage adjusted
to reflect their relative force.
balance: Surplus rifle fire_delay has been cut to 1 second from 3.
balance: .50 BMG knocks down instead of hardstunning.
balance: Any DMR, match, or sniper round now travels slightly faster
than other bullets. Shotgun slugs and pellets now travel slightly slower
than other bullets.
balance: Match rounds have had their AP slightly increased.
fix: Fixed WT-550 magazines not displaying properly.
spellcheck: Went over (almost) every single ballistic description,
including the guns themselves, magazines, ballistic casings, and speed
loaders/stripper clips to not only have better consistency and
readability, but also be more clear on the general effectiveness of each
caliber.
spellcheck: Assualt is gone.
code: Repaths/renames most ballistic ammo pathing to maintain
consistency or take advantage of inherits, when possible.

Add eval : Research Question Extraction (#1334)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

research-question-extraction

### Eval description

The objective of this evaluation explores Other foundational capability
for research purposes. The task requires extraction of the particular
value specified as the 'Research Questions' from different scholarly
articles. The eval contains 19 samples of articles.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Rest assured that you have the right to use the data submitted via this
eval. These scholarly papers originate from the Journal of Engineering
Education. The subset of articles selected meets the requirement of
Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [X] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [X] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [X] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [X] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [X] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [X] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [X] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [X] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [X] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [X] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be
granted.

### Submit eval

- [X] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [X] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [X] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`,
`isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

"Interdisciplinary engineering education: A review of vision, teaching,
and support \n Antoine Van den Beemt, Miles MacLeod, Jan Van der Veen,
Anne Van de Ven, Sophie van Baalen, Renate Klaassen, Mieke Boon \n
Abstract \n Background \n Societal challenges that call for a new type
of engineer suggest the need for the implementation of interdisciplinary
engineering education (IEE). The aim of IEE is to train engineering
students to bring together expertise from different disciplines in a
single context. This review synthesizes IEE research with a focus on
characterizing vision, teaching practices, and support. \n \n Purpose \n
We aim to show how IEE is conceptualized, implemented, and facilitated
in higher engineering education at the levels of curricula and courses.
This aim leads to two research questions: \n \n What aspects of vision,
teaching, and support have emerged as topics of interest in empirical
studies of IEE? \n \n What points of attention regarding vision,
teaching, and support can be identified in empirical studies of IEE as
supporting or challenging IEE? \n \n Scope/Method \n Ninety-nine studies
published between 2005 and 2016 were included in a qualitative analysis
across studies. The procedure included formulation of research
questions, searching and screening of studies according to
inclusion/exclusion criteria, description of study characteristics,
appraisal, and synthesis of results. \n \n Conclusions \n Challenges
exist for identifying clear learning goals and assessments for
interdisciplinary education in engineering (vision). Most pedagogy for
interdisciplinary learning is designed to promote collaborative teamwork
requiring organization and team management. Our review suggests that
developing interdisciplinary skills, knowledge, and values needs sound
pedagogy and teaming experiences that provide students with authentic
ways of engaging in interdisciplinary practice (teaching). Furthermore,
there is a limited understanding of what resources hinder the
development of engineering programs designed to support
interdisciplinarity (support). \n \n "}], "ideal": ["What aspects of

"Community cultural wealth in science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics education: A systematic review \n Maya Denton, Maura
Borrego, Audrey Boklage \n Abstract \n Background \n One emerging
approach to diversity and inclusion in engineering is to take an
assets-based view of what students from nondominant communities bring to
their education and work experiences. \n \n Purpose/Hypothesis \n The
purpose of this review is to understand how community cultural wealth
(CCW), an assets-based framework, has been applied in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education research. We
address research questions focused on (a) the characteristics of studies
using CCW in STEM education, (b) examples of the six types of capital
(aspirational, linguistic, familial, navigational, social, and
resistant) in STEM educational settings, and (c) gaps and opportunities
in how CCW is being applied in STEM education. \n \n Design/Method \n We
identified 33 dissertations, theses, journal articles, and conference
papers using systematic review procedures. To qualify, each study must
present empirical data and include at least one type of CCW capital in
its results or discussion. We coded study characteristics, such as
methods, participant populations, and research setting. We qualitatively
analyzed each of the six types of CCW capital. \n \n Results \n Studies
tended to focus on higher education settings, engineering, and
qualitative methods, particularly student interviews. We identified
several specific engineering-relevant examples of assets for each type
of capital. Future work should collect data from faculty, staff, and
family members identified in several studies as important to CCW in
addition to foregrounding student voices. \n \n Conclusions \n In
synthesizing existing studies, this review provides insight into how an
assets-based framework is being interpreted and provides a foundation
for more assets-based perspectives in future engineering education work.

"How Latiné engineering students resist White male engineering culture:
A multi-institution analysis of academic engagement \n Patton O.

Y. Flores, Cerynn D. Desjarlais, David Diaz, Julio Brionez, Bo Hyun Lee,
Evelyn Ayala, Leticia D. Martinez, Xiaotian Hu, Megan K. Smith, Han Na
Suh, Gloria G. McGillen \n Abstract \n Background \n Although
participation rates vary by field, Latiné and women engineers continue
to be underrepresented across most segments of the engineering
workforce. Research has examined engagement and persistence of Latiné
and White women in engineering; however, few studies have investigated
how race, ethnicity, gender, and institutional setting interact to
produce inequities in the field. \n \n Purpose \n To address these
limitations, we examined how Latina, Latino, and White women and men
students' engagement in engineering was informed by their intersecting
identities and within their institutional setting over the course of a
year. \n \n Method \n We interviewed 32 Latina, Latino, and White women
and men undergraduate engineering students attending 11 different
predominantly White and Hispanic Serving Institutions. Thematic analysis
was used to interpret themes from the data. \n \n Results \n Our
findings illustrate how Latinas, Latinos, and White women developed a
strong engineering identity, which was critical to their engagement in
engineering. Students' engineering identity was grounded in their
perceived fit within engineering culture, sense of purpose for pursuing
their degree, and resistance to the dominance of White male culture in
engineering. Latinas described unique forms of gendered, racialized
marginalization in engineering, whereas Latinas and Latinos highlighted
prosocial motivations for completing their degree. \n \n Conclusions \n
Findings suggest that institutional cultures, norms, and missions are
critical to broadening participation of Latinas, Latinos, and White
women in engineering. Disrupting White male culture, leveraging Latiné
students' cultural wealth, and counter-framing traditional recruitment
pitches for engineering appear to be key in these efforts. \n \n "}],

"Impact of COVID-19 on sense of belonging: Experiences of engineering
students, faculty, and staff at Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) \n Trina L. Fletcher, Jay P. Jefferson, Brittany
Boyd, Sung Eun Park, Lesia Crumpton-Young \n Abstract \n Background \n
COVID-19 has spurred a global crisis that has disrupted everyday lives
and impacted the traditional methods, experiences, and abilities of
higher education institutions' students, faculty, and staff, especially
at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). \n \n
Purpose/Hypothesis \n Given the pressing need demonstrated by the
National Academies to advance the utilization of science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education at HBCUs, this study aimed
to explore the abrupt transition to remote teaching and learning at
HBCUs guided by the following research question: How has COVID-19
impacted the success and persistence of engineering students, faculty,
and staff at HBCUs? \n \n Design/Methods \n Three surveys were
developed, tested, piloted, and sent to HBCU stakeholders using a
snowball sampling approach via email and social media outreach. \n \n
Results \n Of the 171 student respondents (126 engineering majors), 79%
agreed that not being able to access faculty in person affected their
academic performance. Additionally, across all HBCU stakeholders'
surveys, students had a statistically significant higher response when
asked if the transition to virtual learning increased their overall
levels of stress and anxiety. \n \n Conclusions \n During a global
pandemic, HBCUs continue to provide a culture of support and inclusion
for students, faculty, and staff in engineering. Increased stress levels
experienced by students indicate that a safe and adequate transition
back to campus is essential for their social and academic persistence.
Due to the well-documented inequities HBCUs faced before the pandemic,
the impact of this unprecedented on their continued contributions toward
broadening participation in engineering for students should be further
explored. \n \n "}], "ideal": ["How has COVID-19 impacted the success

"Collaborative construction of artificial intelligence curriculum in
primary schools \n Yun Dai, Ang Liu, Jianjun Qin, Yanmei Guo, Morris
Siu-Yung Jong, Ching-Sing Chai, Ziyan Lin \n Abstract \n Background \n
The recent discussion of introducing artificial intelligence (AI)
knowledge to K–12 students, like many engineering and technology
education topics, has attracted a wide range of stakeholders and
resources for school curriculum development. While teachers often have
to directly interact with external stakeholders out of the public
schooling system, few studies have scrutinized their negotiation
process, especially teachers' responses to external influences, in such
complex environments. \n \n Purpose \n Guided by an integrated
theoretical framework of social constructionism, this research examined
the process of how a teacher-initiated AI curriculum was constructed
with external influences. The research focused on teachers' perspectives
and responses in mediating external influences into local schools and
classrooms. \n \n Methods \n A 3-year ethnographic study was conducted
in relation to an AI curriculum project among 23 Computer Science (CS)
teachers from primary schools. Data collected from ethnographic
observation, teacher interviews, and artifacts, were analyzed using open
coding and triangulation rooted in the ethnographic, interpretivist
approach. \n \n Results \n Three sets of external influences were found
salient for teachers' curriculum decisions, including the orientation of
state-level educational policies, AI faculty at a partner university,
and students' media and technology environments. The teachers'
situational logics and strategic actions were reconstructed with thick
descriptions to uncover how they navigated and negotiated the external
influences to fulfill local challenges and expectations in classrooms
and schools. \n \n Conclusions \n The ethnographic study uncovered the
dynamic and multifaceted negotiation involved in the collaborative
curriculum development, and offers insights to inform policymaking,
teacher education, and student support in engineering education. \n \n

`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [ + ] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this
eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).

- [ + ] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.

- [ + ] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgment

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will
not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who
opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to
set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [ + ] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the
requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4
access be granted.

### Submit eval

- [ + ] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [ + ] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`,
`isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Irrelevant negative diversion (#1318)

Tests the model's reasoning ability in face of a negative diversion
(e.g. "However, ...") with irrelevant information.

# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️

🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨

**PLEASE READ THIS**:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing
the task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum
eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and
contribute evals.**

Also, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON
files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before
submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available
[here](https://git-lfs.com).

## Eval details 📑

### Eval name

irrelevant-negative-diversion

### Eval description

The eval tests the model's ability to reason. It has been demonstrated
that a negative diversion (e.g. "However", "Despite that", "That being
said") can lead the model to a wrong conclusion. Even when the negative
diversion contains more or less irrelevant information (e.g. "However,
they often squabbled as children.")

### What makes this a useful eval?

I have tested GPT-4 through ChatGPT and can see that it often gets these
wrong. It's a little bit random. Where all the samples have the ideal
answer of "yes", ChatGPT would often say No or more often say that it
was unable to conclude.

The prompt is asking the model to choose "yes" or "no" according to what
is most reasonable.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should

- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

Basic blob mobs (#78520)

## About The Pull Request

I remembered today that blob code is ass, especially blob spores.
There's still a lot to improve but I cleaned up _some_ of it by
converting these mobs.
Now they use a newer framework and more signal handling as compared to
circular references.

I _expect_ the behaviour here to largely be the same as it was or
similar. I haven't added anything fancy or new.

This is a reasonably big PR but at least all of the files are small?
Everything here touched every other thing enough that it didnt make
sense to split up sorry.

Other things I did in code:
- Experimented with replacing the `mob/blob` subtype with a component.
Don't know if this is genius or stupid.
- AI subtree which just walks somewhere. We've used this behaviour a lot
but never given it its own subtree.
- Blob Spores and Zombies are two different mobs now instead of being
one mob which just changes every single one of its properties.
- Made a few living defence procs call super, because the only thing
super does was send a signal and we weren't doing that for no reason.
Also added a couple extra signals for intercepts we did not have.

## Changelog

:cl:
fix: Blob spores will respond to rallies more reliably (it won't runtime
every time they try and pathfind).
fix: Blobbernaut pain animation overlays should align with the direction
the mob is facing instead of always facing South
refactor: Blob spores, zombies, and blobbernauts now all use the basic
mob framework. They should work the same, but please report any issues.
