1. should fix fax machine problem(thx forest)
2.  gives trucker synth the frontier jumpsuit(Thwomplert)
3. adds Freelancer Synthetic. This Synth is one that was bought off a
civi market and reprogrammed, or stolen and reprogrammed, or hacked, You
get the point - its going with a band of freelancers. The idea behind it
is that this synth's team is dead and they are just programmed as a merc
for pay - hoping to someday find their boss boss and give the money as
set up. I always thought about this one for a long time and decided to
put him in the civilian category, where its hard to roll and also gives
you freedom to choose your allegiance. In this case I hope that a
freelancer synthetic will open up unique avenue of RP and allegiance.
I've only explored it once ingame, but it was very good for RP!
Hopefully people can recreate this success.

was hard to make this guy look cool and I also wasn't sure on what his
loadout would be. I ended up giving him random generic stuff while
looking like a beat up freelancer(missing the armor especially hurt his
look, since thats the largest piece of a freelancer - the curiass, but I
don't want to give armor for balance reasons) and no beret because its
for a SL only.

as usual, if a synth wants to change RP avenues and don different
clothes for different RP, no one would know the difference
# Explain why it's good for the game
1. bug bad
2. a beat up UA laborer that so happens to be synthetic. you wouldn't
expect it because there's so many similar looking people! exactly the
job of a synth - to blend in.
3. Freelancer colony synth hopefully will open up a unique avenue of RP.
If they don't want to they can always ditch it - but its on a relatively
rare and uncommon roll anyways.

Fuck RUST.

All this hype that rust is better is nothing short but vaporware of
lies, rust doesn't add anything to the table, the safety thing they say
is just a simple section in the compiler that checks how object go
around, this can be achieved in c++ if a static analyzer can be coded
into the compilers which I believe will soon be supported. The
ownership-borrow mechanism is akin to c++ constructors-destructors,
python __enter__-__exit__ and any language which the
compiler/interpreter promisses to do an action after some action can
achieve this, example the try{...}finally{...} in javascript can be used
to implements this contextuallike feature.
Using the RAII, c++ is memory safe, provided the programmer is carefull
of how they use the objects, c++ is even better that way.
I hereon say, FUCK YOU RUST.

Big update, various improvements and fixes, slight rewrite

-Adapted my code to be compatible with the Zero-K version

-Rewrote slightly the code to be more concise and efficient

-Fixed: The Zero-K version is broken since an edit made Sep 2020 (!) when user start to change spacing, the rectangles would never disappear because newspacing variable was never falsified at the end of the  Update round.

-Fixed: the param for spTraceScreenRay was the opposite of what it should be

-Improvement: The widget now adapt to the wrong engine grid which is off and also sometimes misleading when it comes to place units on water

-Added: On this particular case, widget gives the possibility for the user to either follow the grid coherence, or show the reality of where the unit will actually be placed. In that case, an extra rect is drawn to see where the first placement will land.  By usage, it seems the latter is more interesting so I put it on by default.
(More details in the comments that could help fix the problem with the engine)

-Improvement: the option panel now stop resetting scroll anytime an option is changed, this fix could easily be implemented universally by changing WG.crude.OpenPath, all it have to do is remembering 'scrollPosY' of the last panel and apply it to the new.

-Added: an option  for the user to choose wether rects should spread straightforward (if user want to only have a basic glance of the separation with no simulation of placing on the ground) or follow the ground, as it was before. I'm undecided which is the best as default for new users.

-Added: an option to have different colors of rects for bad placements, this on default if follow ground is on default, it seems to be adding a plus mostly in this case.

-Changed Description that's been edited, it does not just memorize spacing. I understand that it need to be concise, but a description is meant also to say what it does. User won't be able to tell if that widget make the previsualization or add mouse wheel to spacing by reading its description.

-Changed back title of an option. The purpose of how they are written is to build a sentence obviously, to make it more straightforward and user friendly. This change broke that concept. When user, especially new user, dive into options they can be lost as I was, to understand what option do what, if the option is dependent of another, etc... that's the purpose of my system to make all that as clear as I can.

-Changed back some default for new user, I think having the shift+mousewheel is a must, it's faster and more convenient, especially when discovering the game. I would have been glad to have that when I started, (that's, by the way, why I rewrote this widget in the first place).
Also changed back previsualization, with only 2 rects and only when spacing change, and for 0.7 sec
It is, in my opinion, also much more convenient for a new user to be able to see in a quick glance how your placement will be separated without the need of start posing queue and THEN realize the spacing is not good. If non-new user get tired of it, they will be able to find the options to undo it.
Indeed, new user will not be anymore really a new user when he discovers previsualization, if it's not on by default.

-Few minor things:
  -preGame is now set by GameFrame and then GameFrame removes itself
  -MouseWheel gets added/removed whenever shift+wheel option is changed
  -I don't see any reason to change the name spaced_rects in spaced_rects_2. As far as I know, one can only want that for resetting his own option to default for testing  purpose. Reverted it since it didn't make sense.
  -Upped the max time before infinite for show value and show rects to 10 sec
  -Didn't reverted it but imho, changing 'p' to 'placement' made the code uselessly more cumbersome than it already is.
  -Changed 'if not placementCache[unitDefID] then'  to 'if not placeTable[unitDefID] then' as the code was intended to mean
  note about this: since the vast majority of building have same sizex and sizez, maybe it could be improved by checking if it's relevant to consider the off-facing in 
  before.
 -Estomped the double dots before option titles when they are active, to make them less present.
 -update placement on more relevant changement of facing
 -Made the options defaults in concordance with the widget defaults
 -And maybe some other stuff I forgot

Lots of change, so please, let me know what you think.

Over the past year, we've worked together to build and improve this project. It has been an incredible journey, and I'm immensely grateful for all the contributions, feedback, and support from each one of you. This project has not only helped me improve my Python skills but has also been a great opportunity to explore and learn more about computer systems.

However, as the saying goes, all good things must come to an end. As I approach the final year of my school journey, I find myself needing to focus on my academic responsibilities and make room for new opportunities ahead. Therefore, I have decided to step back from actively maintaining this project.

I want to express my sincere appreciation to everyone who has participated in this project, be it through code contributions, issue reporting, or offering valuable insights. Your involvement has been the driving force behind the project's success.

I'm happy to announce that noahmajors, one of the contributors to this project, has taken the initiative to fork the repository and continue its development. You can find the active fork at the following link: https://github.com/f4kedre4lity/Blank-Grabber

I encourage you all to show your support to noahmajors and the new direction they will take the project. Please consider contributing to the fork if you are interested in its future development.

While this marks the end of my direct involvement with this project, I sincerely hope that the codebase and knowledge shared here will continue to benefit the community.

Thank you all once again for being part of this journey. I wish you all the best in your endeavors and hope our paths may cross again in the future.

Hey what if I made Sleeping Carp better at nonlethal takedowns and also deflect with combat mode instead of throw mode (but cost more) (#79517)

## About The Pull Request

It's been a hot minute hasn't it?

When I initially reworked Sleeping Carp, we didn't have combat mode. Now
that we do, and that Sleeping Carp has substantially less defensive
power to justify having to make a choice between deflection and
attacking, it's probably about time we updated this aspect back to what
it was before my rework. Sorta.

Now, we can have all the deniability of the previous method, while also
letting you reliably protect yourself from ranged attacks at all times
while it matters. Because of this, I increased the price up to 17 TC
because of this change just to be on the safe side. The higher uptime of
projectile immunity while also being able to attack during that time
makes this a lot stronger overall.

Secondly, Sleeping Carp presently just isn't as good as a good ol'
baton. It takes a lot more hits to accomplish the same task that a baton
can. Many people feel like they can't even reasonably fight anyone for
fear of the baton, or they would rather use a baton and kill someone at
their leisure. So we've updated some of the moves in order to facilitate
Sleeping Carp as a substantial contender for 1v1 fighting, and lessen
the need for a baton by adding a lot more Stamina damage overall to the
various attacks;

**Keelhaul**: Now a Shove Shove combo. Does literally zero lethal
damage, but now temporarily blinds and dizzies the target as well as its
previous effects. The amount of lethal damage it did was...extremely
small, so this isn't a particularly big loss.

**Grabs and Shoves**: Deal some amount of stamina damage (20). You need
to be in combat mode in order to perform these special attacks (more
deniability). Grabbing someone while they have 80 Stamina damage or more
will cause them to fall unconscious. Yes, I really did just want to add
a Vulcan Nerve Pinch, what do you want from me?

That's it actually. Oh, I guess they are heavy sleepers now too. Because
its funny.

## Why It's Good For The Game

I often get told (read: thrown various insults and slurs at me while
mentioning this as the justification) that Sleeping Carp is not very
strong anymore since it lost all that invisible armor I added way back +
I removed the stuns in my initial rework. This made some people upset (I
think at least one person wished for my death).

So, having given it at least 2 years, I wanted to recapture parts of
what made the older Sleeping Carp (before my rework) strong, some of the
benefits of the new version, and introduce a brand new aspect; nonlethal
takedowns. This makes it beneficial for pacifists, as well as for
kidnapping.

This should not meaningfully make Sleeping Carp any stronger against the
things that typically ruin its day. I suspect in a straight joust with a
baton, Sleeping Carp will still struggle. But against what should be its
strong points (lone targets and ranged weapons), it will be strong once
again rather than clumsily unable to do very much at all.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Harnessing Shoreline Quay (bluespace energy, probably), a
mystical energy (total bullshit) that permeates the Astral Waterways
(bluespace quantum dimensions, probably), Sleeping Carp users can now
once against deflect projectiles with their bare hands when focused in
on battle (in combat mode).
balance: The Keelhaul technique is now nonlethal (a philosophical
acknowledgement of the familial bond of sleep and death), but causes the
target to become temporarily blind and dizzy along with its previous
effects.
balance: Sleeping carp users, while in combat mode, deal Stamina damage
with their grabs and shoves. If the target of their grab has enough
Stamina damage (80), they are knocked unconscious from a well placed
nerve pinch.
balance: Sleeping carp users find it very hard to wake up once they fall
asleep....

Added a fun blood splatter effect

Sometimes when you kill a goblin it splatters blood everywhere. Might
need to adjust this to tone it down a bit... haha it's a bit much.
Noticed combat is wonky after the time management update...

Added a bunch of little heplers to map.c that for some reason didn't
exist already - mostly getting tile information by x,y coordinates
instead of by Vec2i. Sometimes its more useful one way then the other so
to have both the default is by x,y, but can be called by most of those
functions by adding "_vec" to the name (eg get_glyphch_at(x,y) and
get_glyph_ch_at_vec(vec)). Seems minor but boy does that help when you
have to type things like get_glyphch_at(mlist->data->pos.x,mlist->data->pos.y).... get_glyph_ch_at_vec(mlist->data->pos) is hella better.

Adds garbage dumpster ruins (#79446)

## About The Pull Request
Adds 4 small space ruins. Each is a dumpster in space containing hostile
mobs to fight and items to bring back to the station. There's a
decommissioned garbage truck pulling each dumpster which acts as a
staging area before you take on the mobs inside.
All the fights are in cramped dark areas with full pressure, air is
breathable but sometimes has miasma in it so beware of getting sick. So
you can drop your space suit and put on armour, but PKAs won't fire at
full power and keeping a gas mask on is recommended.
Also all the dumpsters look the same from the outside so you gotta crawl
inside to know what's inside. And no you can't metagame it with mesons
either.

Comes in the following flavours:
Food Waste
Full of trash from kitchens, and food. Some of the food is still edible.
There's a lot of territorial rats. You can chop them up into meat if you
want more food. The big prize is a big vat of cooking oil.

Medical Waste
Spare organs, cyberorgans and almost a full set of old surgical gear.
There's a syndicate agent here up to no good and he has a GUN. The gun
blows up when the agent dies so you can't get it. There's a few corpses
of different species in bodybags and some spare corpse parts so you can
bring them back to the station and give them to the coroner. Also a
single use eyestealer in a safe (the cool way to do surgery) and a bug
from the old traitor objective that doesn't do jack but can probably
still get you thrown in perma.

Construction Garbage
Tools and construction materials here, including a cool hammer that fits
in a tool belt and can function as a crowbar. There's also a drug lab
with plenty of weird pills to eat, cigarettes to eat and an angry
russian drug dealer who will stab you if he sees you. He has a badass
lighter and a flamethrower you can take after you kill him. Setting fire
to things in here is not recommended because of all the welding fuel.

Mall Trash
Action figures, trading cards, Christmas crackers and other trash the
local mall tossed out. Also a mothman used to live here but he got eaten
by giant spiders so you can grab his stuff, including snacks and a
civilian modsuit with no mods (wow). You can cut through the webs to
kill the spiders or let them eat you too if you want.
## Why It's Good For The Game
More content for space explorers.
More variety to the potential dangers of space, now u can get sick and
die or get eaten by rats (this is hobo RP)
Better environmental storytelling. Now instead of players left asking
"what happens to the garbage when it goes into space" they can rest
assured that there's busted ass garbage trucks in space. All their
questions are answered.
Loot that encourages working with people on the station. Raw food for
the kitchen, rats for genetics, organs for the coroner, etc
## Changelog
:cl:
add: 4 new space ruins

Changes to the lore of Knock (#79542)

## About The Pull Request

This PR renames Knock to Lock, and changes most of the knowledge gain
lore.

## Why It's Good For The Game

The Knock Lore, is based on the Knock Principle from Cultist Simulator,
with the path description being copied from the wiki. Many other
keywords and concepts are fully lifted from that game (Locksmith's
Secret, Mother Of Ants, etc). In my vision, if a heretic path has to be
based on a principle from cultist simulator, it should have its own
spin, and also, the knowledge gain texts should tell a story. For
example, Ash tells the story of a watchman burning down their city after
being betrayed, and Cosmic is a love story between a knowledge seeker
and a monster from the beyond.

So I have decided to reflavour Knock. I have changed the name to Lock,
so at least it would feel similar, just like how Blade is akin to Edge.
Many powers also block people or confuse their paths instead of opening
new ways, and thus, I feel a path whose name implies that it *both*
opens and closes would be more self describing.

I have changed most of its lore to be about the Locked Labyrinth, where
knowledge seekers willingly trap themselves and submit themselves to
servitude to find ultimate freedom by progressing through its trials.
These are the Stewards, who are basically workers in an infinite and
malicious hotel in their dreams. Consider them assistants if you will
(this wasn't my intention when I wrote the lore, but thinking about it
in retrospect, it honestly fits). In the implied story, the heretic
joins their ranks, but keeps getting closer to the more corrupt members,
along with parasitic spirits. Ultimately, they manage to open the
Labyrinth's core, letting out the Stewards, allowing them to manifest in
the forms of heretic summon creatures.

The side path spells and the lock knowledge ritual I have not touched,
they were fine. Some items have been renamed and repathed.

I have kept the distinctive sound effect for using the Grasp, as its
unique enough. Though if someone did have a nice sound effect for
turning a lock and added some filters, I would add it.

**DB Issue**

I have renamed the achievement's define to MEDAL_LOCK_ASCENSION but kept
the value as "Knock", as I don't know how trigger a change in the DB. If
this is a blocking change, I'll try to figure out how to make a
migration file.

**Future improvements**

I would also come back later with another PR, that hands out names to
the eldritch beings spawned by the portal, based on the Stewards in the
knowledge gain lore that I added, along with some new ones that fit the
theme, and some jokey ones like Minotaur.

## Changelog

:cl:
spellcheck: Renamed Knock to Locks, and changed most of the flavor text
of knowledge gain, and renamed some items and knowledges from the path.

Fix contract assertion firing with SG OOP syncing.

This was a very subtle issue. It was found thanks to some paranoid asserts added when doing the "perform SG generation in OOP process" work.

First, some background. We have a type called SourceText which represents the string-oriented (not byte-oriented) contents of a file. That type also exposes a concept of the "content checksum". This content checksum corresponds to the original bytes the source-text was created from, and not necessarily the current 'string-oriented view' the SourceText represents.

In other words, the following axiom does NOT hold:

sourceText.GetChecksum() == SourceText.From(sourceText.ToString(), sourceText.Encoding, sourceText.HashAlgorithm).GetChecksum()

As an example of when this might happen, consider that the bytes of a file may or may not include the BOM for utf8. So you might have two files with different byte contents that end up representing the same char contents.

Unfortunately, the SG OOP syncing code assumed the above was true. If would sync over file contents, then assert that the checksum we then produced on the host side matched what was on the OOP side. This assertion was not valid given the above, and our connection would die.

The fix is not to just to remove the assertion though. If we did that, we'd end up in a bad state where the host and the OOP side would always disagree on the content checksum of these SG files, causing them to resync on each solution fork. That would be very bad for perf (Esp. as SG files can be enormous). The fix instead is to understand that the checksum on the OOP side may not be computable on the host side, and instead just trust and use that server-side-computed checksum locally for all checksum related questions we have.

Note: A cleaner fix will be possible if/when we get approval on the following API suggestion: #70752. With that API we would be able to produce a SourceText locally with the exact same checksum as what was on the OOP side. This would be nice to have in the long term so that if we have any other code that ends up looking directly at the SourceText for its checksum, it doesn't get confused as to why the host and OOP disagree on it.

Basic Guardians/Holoparasites (#79473)

## About The Pull Request

Fixes #79485
Fixes #77552

Converts Guardians (aka Holoparasites) into Basic Mobs.
Changes a bunch of their behaviours into actions or components which we
can reuse.
Replaces some verbs it would give to you and hide in the status panel
with action buttons that you may be able to find more quickly.

They _**should**_ work basically like they did before but a bit
smoother. It is not unlikely that I made some changes by accident or
just by changing framework though.

My one creative touch was adding random name suggestions.
The Wizard federation have a convention of naming their arcane spirit
guardians by combining a colour and a major arcana of the tarot. The
Syndicate of course won't truck with any of that mystical claptrap and
for their codenames use the much more sensible construction of a colour
and a gamepiece.

This lets you be randomly assigned such creative names as "Sparkling
Hermit", "Bloody Queen", "Blue World", or "Purple Diamond".
You can of course still ignore this entirely and type "The Brapmaster"
into the box if so desired.

I made _one_ other intentional change, which is to swap to Mothblocks'
nice leash component instead of instantly teleporting guardians back to
you when they are pulled out of the edge of their range. They should now
be "dragged" along behind you until they can't path, at which point they
will teleport. This should make the experience a bit less disorienting,
you have the recall button if you _want_ to instantly catch up.

This is unfortunately a bumper-sized PR because it did not seem
plausible to not do all of it at once, but I can make a project branch
for atomisation if people think this is too much of a pain in the ass to
review.

Other changes:
- Some refactoring to how the charge action works so I could
individually override "what you can hit" and "what happens when you hit"
instead of those being the same proc
- Lightning Guardian damage chain is now a component
- Explosive Guardian explosive trap is now a component
- Added even more arguments to the Healing Touch component to allow it
to heal tox/oxy damage and require a specific click modifier
- Life Link component which implements the Guardian behaviour of using
another mob as your health bar
- Moved some stuff about deciding what guardians look and are described
like into a theming datum
- Added a generic proc which can return whether your mob is meant to
apply some kind of damage multiplier to a certain damage type. It's not
perfect because I couldn't figure out how ot cram limb modifiers in
there, which is where most of it is on carbons. Oh well.
- Riders of vehicles now inherit all movement traits of those vehicles,
so riding a charging holoparasite will let you cross chasms. Also works
if you piggyback someone with wings, probably.

## Changelog

:cl:
refactor: Guardians/Powerminers/Holoparasites now use the basic mob
framework. Please report any unexpected changes or behaviour.
qol: The verbs used to communicate with, recall, or banish your Guardian
are now action buttons.
balance: If (as a Guardian) your host moves slightly out of range you
will now be dragged back into range if possible, rather than being
instantly teleported to them.
balance: Protectors now have a shorter leash range rather than a longer
one, in order to more easily take advantage of their ability to drag
their charge out of danger.
balance: Ranged Guardians can now hold down the mouse button to fire
automatically.
balance: People riding vehicles or other mobs now inherit all of their
movement traits, so riding a flying mob (or vehicle, if we have any of
those) will allow you to cross chasms and lava safely.

Correct copy/move for `union`

By writing separate construction and assignment, plus the new feature of suppressing assignment to a member by writing `member = _ ;` (now allowed only in assignment operators).

I do realize that's an "opt-out" which I normally prefer to avoid, but:

- I considered and decided against (for now) the alternative of not having assignment be memberwise by default. I want to keep the (new to Cpp2) default of memberwise semantics for assignment as with construction. I think that's a useful feature, and normally if you do assign to a member it doesn't arise, and so I think it makes sense to explicitly call out when we're choosing not to do any assignment at all to a member before doing other assignment processing. We'll get experience with how it goes.

- `_` is arguably natural here, since it's pronounced "don't care." There too, we'll see if that is natural generalized, or feels strained. For now it feels natural to me.

net: sctp: fix ipv6 ipsec encryption bug in sctp_v6_xmit

[ Upstream commit 95ee62083cb6453e056562d91f597552021e6ae7 ]

Alan Chester reported an issue with IPv6 on SCTP that IPsec traffic is not
being encrypted, whereas on IPv4 it is. Setting up an AH + ESP transport
does not seem to have the desired effect:

SCTP + IPv4:

  22:14:20.809645 IP (tos 0x2,ECT(0), ttl 64, id 0, offset 0, flags [DF], proto AH (51), length 116)
    192.168.0.2 > 192.168.0.5: AH(spi=0x00000042,sumlen=16,seq=0x1): ESP(spi=0x00000044,seq=0x1), length 72
  22:14:20.813270 IP (tos 0x2,ECT(0), ttl 64, id 0, offset 0, flags [DF], proto AH (51), length 340)
    192.168.0.5 > 192.168.0.2: AH(spi=0x00000043,sumlen=16,seq=0x1):

SCTP + IPv6:

  22:31:19.215029 IP6 (class 0x02, hlim 64, next-header SCTP (132) payload length: 364)
    fe80::222:15ff:fe87:7fc.3333 > fe80::92e6:baff:fe0d:5a54.36767: sctp
    1) [INIT ACK] [init tag: 747759530] [rwnd: 62464] [OS: 10] [MIS: 10]

Moreover, Alan says:

  This problem was seen with both Racoon and Racoon2. Other people have seen
  this with OpenSwan. When IPsec is configured to encrypt all upper layer
  protocols the SCTP connection does not initialize. After using Wireshark to
  follow packets, this is because the SCTP packet leaves Box A unencrypted and
  Box B believes all upper layer protocols are to be encrypted so it drops
  this packet, causing the SCTP connection to fail to initialize. When IPsec
  is configured to encrypt just SCTP, the SCTP packets are observed unencrypted.

In fact, using `socat sctp6-listen:3333 -` on one end and transferring "plaintext"
string on the other end, results in cleartext on the wire where SCTP eventually
does not report any errors, thus in the latter case that Alan reports, the
non-paranoid user might think he's communicating over an encrypted transport on
SCTP although he's not (tcpdump ... -X):

  ...
  0x0030: 5d70 8e1a 0003 001a 177d eb6c 0000 0000  ]p.......}.l....
  0x0040: 0000 0000 706c 6169 6e74 6578 740a 0000  ....plaintext...

Only in /proc/net/xfrm_stat we can see XfrmInTmplMismatch increasing on the
receiver side. Initial follow-up analysis from Alan's bug report was done by
Alexey Dobriyan. Also thanks to Vlad Yasevich for feedback on this.

SCTP has its own implementation of sctp_v6_xmit() not calling inet6_csk_xmit().
This has the implication that it probably never really got updated along with
changes in inet6_csk_xmit() and therefore does not seem to invoke xfrm handlers.

SCTP's IPv4 xmit however, properly calls ip_queue_xmit() to do the work. Since
a call to inet6_csk_xmit() would solve this problem, but result in unecessary
route lookups, let us just use the cached flowi6 instead that we got through
sctp_v6_get_dst(). Since all SCTP packets are being sent through sctp_packet_transmit(),
we do the route lookup / flow caching in sctp_transport_route(), hold it in
tp->dst and skb_dst_set() right after that. If we would alter fl6->daddr in
sctp_v6_xmit() to np->opt->srcrt, we possibly could run into the same effect
of not having xfrm layer pick it up, hence, use fl6_update_dst() in sctp_v6_get_dst()
instead to get the correct source routed dst entry, which we assign to the skb.

Also source address routing example from 625034113 ("sctp: fix sctp to work with
ipv6 source address routing") still works with this patch! Nevertheless, in RFC5095
it is actually 'recommended' to not use that anyway due to traffic amplification [1].
So it seems we're not supposed to do that anyway in sctp_v6_xmit(). Moreover, if
we overwrite the flow destination here, the lower IPv6 layer will be unable to
put the correct destination address into IP header, as routing header is added in
ipv6_push_nfrag_opts() but then probably with wrong final destination. Things aside,
result of this patch is that we do not have any XfrmInTmplMismatch increase plus on
the wire with this patch it now looks like:

SCTP + IPv6:

  08:17:47.074080 IP6 2620:52:0:102f:7a2b:cbff:fe27:1b0a > 2620:52:0:102f:213:72ff:fe32:7eba:
    AH(spi=0x00005fb4,seq=0x1): ESP(spi=0x00005fb5,seq=0x1), length 72
  08:17:47.074264 IP6 2620:52:0:102f:213:72ff:fe32:7eba > 2620:52:0:102f:7a2b:cbff:fe27:1b0a:
    AH(spi=0x00003d54,seq=0x1): ESP(spi=0x00003d55,seq=0x1), length 296

This fixes Kernel Bugzilla 24412. This security issue seems to be present since
2.6.18 kernels. Lets just hope some big passive adversary in the wild didn't have
its fun with that. lksctp-tools IPv6 regression test suite passes as well with
this patch.

Nukie Update Followup: Returns CQC to the previous price range, Core Gear kit for newbies, hat stabilizers for everyone (#79232)

## About The Pull Request

Brings the CQC kit back down to the same price range of 14 TC (it's 1
more than before weapon kits). It feels like currently that CQC is
overpriced, even with the stealth box coming along with it, and by
comparison the energy sword and shield got a huge value increase by
combining the two. They're both melee styles and also equally difficult
play styles. It isn't really necessary to make one more expensive than
the other. Also now comes with syndicate smokes. It's a whatever change,
ops get these for free on the base.

Adds a core gear kit in the weapon category. This kit comes with a
doormag, a freedom implant, stimpack and c-4 charge. All of these are
items almost every nukie buys if they want to succeed, so let's inform
newer players by putting it RIGHT on top of the list. This isn't at any
discount, this is mostly to help inform players what items help make you
successful.

Hat stabilizers are now a part of every syndicate modsuit for FREE. It
comes built in, can't be removed, and has no complexity cost. Now
everyone can wear their wacky hats as they operate.

## Why It's Good For The Game

CQC felt like it got shafted waaay too hard with the weapon case
changes. Definitely don't believe that it is punching at the same weight
as many of the other high cost weapons. So we've dropped it down a
category. 14 TC is still a large upfront cost, even if it comes bundled
with a lot of goods.

Melbert gave me the idea of a core bundle kit to help newer players and
I was really taken with that. So I added it as part of this followup.

I want people to wear their hats goddamnit, and I didn't learn my
mistake with the tool parcels. So now everyone has hat stands on their
suits. WEAR THE SOMBRERO YOU **FUCK**.

### THIS IS NOW A THREAT.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Operatives can once again read about the basics of CQC at a
reasonable price of 14 TC.
qol: All Syndicate MODsuits come with the potent ability to wear hats on
their helmets FOR FREE. No longer does any operative need be shamed by
their bald helmet's unhatted state when they spot the captain, in their
MODsuit, wearing a hat on their helmet. The embarrassment has resulted
in more than a few operatives prematurely detonating their implants! BUT
NO LONGER! FASHION IS YOURS!
qol: There is now a Core Gear Box, containing a few essential pieces of
gear for success as an operative. This is right at the top of the
uplink, you can't miss it! Great for those operatives just starting out,
or operatives who need all their baseline equipment NOW.

[Security Solution][Detection Engine] improves new terms rule for multiple fields (#157413)

## Summary

As described in our README for new terms rule type:

> Runtime field supports only 100 emitted values. So for large arrays or
combination of values greater than 100, results may not be exhaustive.
This applies only to new terms with multiple fields.
  Following edge cases possible:
- false negatives (alert is not generated) if too many fields were
emitted and actual new values are not getting evaluated if it happened
in document in rule run window.
- false positives (wrong alert generated) if too many fields were
emitted in historical document and some old terms are not getting
evaluated against values in new documents.

To avoid this and deliver the better experience for our customers, this
PR is moving from current implementation(emitting aggregated values for
multiple new terms fields) towards using composite aggregation for each
page from phase 1, split in chunks by 500.
This allowed to be done due
[order](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-composite-aggregation.html#_order)
of composite aggregation results

NOTE: implementation for a single new terms filed is the same, due to
performance reasons

I selected size of the chunk as 500, since it's a bit faster and less
load on CPU

### Considerations on parallel composite search requests in phase 2

When running composite search requests in parallel, noticed significant
CPU increase in Elasticsearch ~ 1,000% for 2 requests in parallel
against ~ 500% for single.
Where win in performance was not that big: ~ 35s for 2 in parallel, 43s
for a single request. I think, having only one request is the better
option to go, that will prevent unnecessary CPU usage

### Test cases
I've added several functional test cases, that ensures, no missing/false
positives alerts are occurring. Applied to the old implementation, they
would fail

### Retry on max_clause_count error
Because we create query, that can have few thousands clauses, it is
possible it may fail due to [the maximum number of allowed
clauses](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-settings.html)
I implemented retry that: If request fails with batch size of 500
(default value), we will try to reduce it in twice per each retried
request, up until 125. Per ES documentation, max_clause_count min value
is 1,000 - so with 125 we should be able execute query below
max_clause_count value

### Checklist

Delete any items that are not applicable to this PR.

- [x] [Unit or functional
tests](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/master/development-tests.html)
were updated or added to match the most common scenarios

In the intricate realm of software development, a pivotal strategic decision has recently been undertakenâa decision of paramount importance for the system known as VectorDrive. This decision has been driven by a tapestry of concerns that have interwoven themselves into the fabric of our coding landscape. At the heart of this choice lies the question of accuracy, a fundamental element that underpins the very essence of our software. The shadows of debugging inefficiencies have cast doubt upon the future of VectorDrive, leading us down the path of archiving this once-vital component of our codebase.

Yet, it would be remiss not to acknowledge that within the depths of this decision, there lies a glimmer of hope, like a distant star on a cloudy night. For as we consign VectorDrive to the annals of history, we recognize the enduring value of its constituent parts. Definitions for Vectors, with their versatile utility in tasks relating to enums, shall be preserved as a testament to their intrinsic worth. Moreover, a whisper of possibility lingers in the airâan ember of potential rekindling. In the CenterStage project, should the winds of necessity blow in its direction, VectorDrive may yet rise from its slumber.

This momentous decision, however, does not exist in isolation. It is but one brushstroke on the canvas of an ongoing odysseyâan odyssey of code reformatting and refactoring. Notable among these endeavors is the transition from the TaskImpl interface to the more intuitively named AutoTask interface. This transition is not a mere exercise in semantics but a resolute commitment to the sacred principle of code clarity.

Beyond the realm of interfaces, the horizon of possibilities stretches wide. The concept of a unified class tailored explicitly for Autonomous-focused OpModes is now under the microscope. The objective is clear: to streamline the activeLoop, fostering a culture of code reusability that echoes through the annals of our development journey.

Yet, the tapestry of evolution does not stop here. It weaves onward, guided by the hands of developers committed to upholding the finest traditions of their craft. Plans are afoot to refactor the codebase itself, aligning it with the latest programming principlesâa move that reflects our commitment to staying ahead of the curve in the upcoming season. In tandem with this pursuit, thoughts swirl around the introduction of abstractions designed to simplify the intricate functionality of Autonomous systems. Such abstractions, if realized, will serve as a boon to developers, rendering our software more accessible and user-friendly.

In the midst of these ambitious undertakings, a formidable challenge has emergedâa challenge wrought by the use of while statements. While these constructs are, at times, indispensable, there exist instances where their presence seems superfluous. Consider, for instance, the integration of ButtonHashmap with Autonâa situation that begs for a solution that mitigates code-blocking behaviors. To this end, the proposal of multithreading or the separation of processes from the OpMode thread has surfacedâa proposition that aims to ensure the uninterrupted execution of critical initialization routines, such as AprilTag and task selections, without the cumbersome wait for user input.

This multifaceted approach to code evolution, entwined with the aspirations for code excellence, underscores our unwavering commitment to continuous improvement. The tapestry of our software development journey is a rich, ever-unfolding narrativeâa narrative guided by the principles of precision, clarity, and innovation. In this intricate landscape, every line of code is a brushstroke on the canvas of progress, and with each stroke, we strive to craft a masterpiece of software engineering.

Makefile.lib: Lower kernel gzip compression to fastest

You're reading this - so you're trying to understand "JUST WHY OMG".
That's already a good step.

First of all, this is a downstream kernel - always keep that in mind!
Now, this kernel is targeting new *very powerful* Qualcomm platforms
like SM8250 and the Sony Edo platform - which has a very fast UFS card.

Keep in mind that the bootloader sets the CPU at a frequency that is
slightly faster than the "in the middle" ones, which is anyway not
veeeery fast - but that's good, really. I agree.

So.. check this out:   for Image.gz-dtb.....
COMP_LEVEL    SIZE
9             20116171
5	      20220479
2	      20940223
1	      21231290

Remember again that we're loading from a UFS card and that
we are loading ~1.1MB more out of a 20MB file.
If you're smart enough you surely know already about RAM and CPU
overhead of very high compression levels.

If you still disagree with what I just did, read this commit description
another 20 times, or more, until you understand it. :)))

Add emotional intelligence evaluation (#589)

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
Emotional Intelligence

### Eval description
Evaluates GPT's ability to understand and manage emotional situations
using modified versions of the well-validated, public (i.e.
license-unrestricted) tests first developed by MacCann & Roberts (2008).
Items have actually here been aggregated across three different scales--
the STEU and STEM adult measures, along with a dozen questions from the
youth measure.

Keep in mind that there is not expectation that AI models like GPT-4
should be able to process emotions, so applying any emotional
intelligence test to them should be taken with a grain of salt. These
tests can only measure the AI's ability to understand and analyze
emotional information, not the AI's emotional intelligence in the human
sense.

### What makes this a useful eval?
This eval is useful because it assesses the AI model's ability to
navigate complex or ambiguous emotional situations, which is an
important aspect of human-like communication and problem-solving. By
evaluating the model's performance in this unique domain, we can
identify areas for improvement and better understand its limitations
when it comes to handling emotional contexts. This is particularly
important when considering AI applications that involve interactions
with humans, such as chatbots, personal assistants, and customer support
systems. A better understanding of emotional intelligence can
potentially lead to more natural and effective interactions between AI
models and their users.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

This Emotional Intelligence eval provides a unique value because by
testing GPT's capacity to understand and manage emotions, we can gain
insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses in a more
human-centric context. Relatedly, this eval also emphasizes the
importance of empathy and emotional understanding in AI systems that are
designed to interact with humans. By evaluating GPT's performance in
this way, we can contribute to the ongoing development of AI models that
are more attuned to human emotions and can provide better support in
emotionally charged situations, such as mental health counseling, crisis
management, and conflict resolution. Moreover, this Emotional
Intelligence eval can serve as a foundation for further research and
development in the field of AI and emotional understanding, paving the
way for more sophisticated AI models capable of handling complex human
emotions and fostering more effective communication.

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval
(data is publicly available on OSF, and does not have usage
restrictions)

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist ð

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

**_I already have access to the 8k GPT-4 API, but I am kindly requesting
access to the 32k as soon as it becomes available._**

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

### Performance:
GPT-4: accuracy=0.48

### Eval JSON data 

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as
many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:

Heart Disease Prediction (#538)

# Thank you for contributing an eval! â¥ï¸

ð¨ Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, __failure to follow
the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically__.
Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR
will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted. ð¨

__PLEASE READ THIS__:

In order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that
right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if
the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep
in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,
we will likely reject since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the
task.

We plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval
performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able
to see the eval performance on GPT-4. We encourage partial PR's with
~5-10 example that we can then run the evals on and share the results
with you so you know how your eval does with GPT-4 before writing all
100 examples.

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
Heart Disease Prediction

### Eval description

This eval tests the models ability to correctly predict the probability
of a patient to have heart disease. The dataset is constructed from the
[Heart Failure Prediction
Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)
on Kaggle. The data includes the patient's age, sex, and a number of
medical signals relevant to the diagnosis of heart disease.

The data is provided under the Open Database License (ODbL). 

```
fedesoriano. (September 2021). Heart Failure Prediction Dataset. Retrieved [Mar 31, 2023] from https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction.
```

### What makes this a useful eval?

This assesses the model's ability to correctly predict adverse medical
events. Correctly predicting heart disease shows the model's capability
for a strong understanding of medicine. The GPT-3.5-turbo models
currently receives an accuracy of 0.778.

## Criteria for a good eval â

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,
we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite
being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some
things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good
evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically
consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some
particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases
where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4
or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means
either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded
eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`
Model-graded eval.
- [x] Include at least 100 high quality examples (it is okay to only
contribute 5-10 meaningful examples and have us test them with GPT-4
before adding all 100)

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please
document it below.

### Unique eval value

> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.
(Not required)

As far as I can tell, this is the only eval so far related to making
medical diagnoses. To make sure it was a high quality eval, I tried to
find a dataset with a lot of observations and created by doctors with
the relevant expertise.

## Eval structure ðï¸

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at
`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing
eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own
cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist ð

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic
and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have
adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the
right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.
Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage
Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT
license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a
limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email
address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if
applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,
help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the
requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not
be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens
a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the
right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements
above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access
granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields in the evals PR form
- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install
pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`,
and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being
closed.

## Eval details ð
### Eval name
finance

### Eval description

Asks the model to calculate how much interest would be owed on a credit
card by a certain date, if a payment was made once but debt remains on
the card.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Finance is likely to be one of the biggest opportunities for LLMs to be
useful, because financial education is incredibly poor globally and the
impact of a mistake in financial calculations is severe. This eval tests
the models ability to combine math with its understanding of a topic
(finance). We plan to use this type of math at
[Dollarwise](https://www.dollarwise.ca) frequently going forward,
including integration into your comparison products. However, for this
to work reliably it's important that the model here can natively
understand financial concepts and apply math to them.

lib/list_sort: optimize number of calls to comparison function

CONFIG_RETPOLINE has severely degraded indirect function call
performance, so it's worth putting some effort into reducing the number
of times cmp() is called.

This patch avoids badly unbalanced merges on unlucky input sizes.  It
slightly increases the code size, but saves an average of 0.2*n calls to
cmp().

x86-64 code size 739 -> 803 bytes (+64)

Unfortunately, there's not a lot of low-hanging fruit in a merge sort;
it already performs only n*log2(n) - K*n + O(1) compares.  The leading
coefficient is already at the theoretical limit (log2(n!) corresponds to
K=1.4427), so we're fighting over the linear term, and the best
mergesort can do is K=1.2645, achieved when n is a power of 2.

The differences between mergesort variants appear when n is *not* a
power of 2; K is a function of the fractional part of log2(n).  Top-down
mergesort does best of all, achieving a minimum K=1.2408, and an average
(over all sizes) K=1.248.  However, that requires knowing the number of
entries to be sorted ahead of time, and making a full pass over the
input to count it conflicts with a second performance goal, which is
cache blocking.

Obviously, we have to read the entire list into L1 cache at some point,
and performance is best if it fits.  But if it doesn't fit, each full
pass over the input causes a cache miss per element, which is
undesirable.

While textbooks explain bottom-up mergesort as a succession of merging
passes, practical implementations do merging in depth-first order: as
soon as two lists of the same size are available, they are merged.  This
allows as many merge passes as possible to fit into L1; only the final
few merges force cache misses.

This cache-friendly depth-first merge order depends on us merging the
beginning of the input as much as possible before we've even seen the
end of the input (and thus know its size).

The simple eager merge pattern causes bad performance when n is just
over a power of 2.  If n=1028, the final merge is between 1024- and
4-element lists, which is wasteful of comparisons.  (This is actually
worse on average than n=1025, because a 1204:1 merge will, on average,
end after 512 compares, while 1024:4 will walk 4/5 of the list.)

Because of this, bottom-up mergesort achieves K < 0.5 for such sizes,
and has an average (over all sizes) K of around 1.  (My experiments show
K=1.01, while theory predicts K=0.965.)

There are "worst-case optimal" variants of bottom-up mergesort which
avoid this bad performance, but the algorithms given in the literature,
such as queue-mergesort and boustrodephonic mergesort, depend on the
breadth-first multi-pass structure that we are trying to avoid.

This implementation is as eager as possible while ensuring that all
merge passes are at worst 1:2 unbalanced.  This achieves the same
average K=1.207 as queue-mergesort, which is 0.2*n better then
bottom-up, and only 0.04*n behind top-down mergesort.

Specifically, defers merging two lists of size 2^k until it is known
that there are 2^k additional inputs following.  This ensures that the
final uneven merges triggered by reaching the end of the input will be
at worst 2:1.  This will avoid cache misses as long as 3*2^k elements
fit into the cache.

(I confess to being more than a little bit proud of how clean this code
turned out.  It took a lot of thinking, but the resultant inner loop is
very simple and efficient.)

Context
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

[Fleet] Fix inability to upgrade agents from 8.10.4 -> 8.11 (#170974)

## Summary

Closes https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/169825

This PR adds logic to Fleet's `/api/agents/available_versions` endpoint
that will ensure we periodically try to fetch from the live product
versions API at https://www.elastic.co/api/product_versions to make sure
we have eventual consistency in the list of available agent versions.

Currently, Kibana relies entirely on a static file generated at build
time from the above API. If the API isn't up-to-date with the latest
agent version (e.g. kibana completed its build before agent), then that
build of Kibana will never "see" the corresponding build of agent.

This API endpoint is cached for two hours to prevent overfetching from
this external API, and from constantly going out to disk to read from
the agent versions file.

## To do
- [x] Update unit tests
- [x] Consider airgapped environments

## On airgapped environments

In airgapped environments, we're going to try and fetch from the
`product_versions` API and that request is going to fail. What we've
seen happen in some environments is that these requests do not "fail
fast" and instead wait until a network timeout is reached.

I'd love to avoid that timeout case and somehow detect airgapped
environments and avoid calling this API at all. However, we don't have a
great deterministic way to know if someone is in an airgapped
environment. The best guess I think we can make is by checking whether
`xpack.fleet.registryUrl` is set to something other than
`https://epr.elastic.co`. Curious if anyone has thoughts on this.

## To test

1. Set up Fleet Server + ES + Kibana
2. Spin up a Fleet Server running Agent v8.11.0
3. Enroll an agent running v8.10.4 (I used multipass)
4. Verify the agent can be upgraded from the UI

Added `Icon.reopen_in_place()` to fix index desync

Uses `WM_CANCELMODE` and `WM_NOTIFY` signals to manually close and
reopen the menu, along with new `Icon.is_open` and `Icon.last_pos`
properties so we know when our menu is open and can reopen from the
same position, making it look like the menu refreshed itself. Added
a `force` parameter and `Icon.close()` for good measure, though
they'll stay unused for now.

Doing this saves us from the headaches caused by clips being added while
the menu is open, which causes actions to affect the wrong clips since
our menu items are based on indexes rather than raw paths. Accordingly,
`self.check_for_clips_thread()` has been slightly reworked to better
protect against index desyncing.

---

This commit originally reused the COM interface trick from PyPlayer to
send a fake `Alt` press to the menu to close it (without reopening it).
The only reason I continued trying to figure out how to close/reopen
correctly (which I knew was possible) was because I got a bit paranoid
about anti-cheat, even though I'm 99.99% sure COM interfaces to other
programs while a game is alt-tabbed would never trigger false-positives.

You can never be too paranoid.

The second version also used `GetForegroundWindow()` instead of adding
`Icon.is_open`, but it proved too unreliable (stays True until you click
something outside of the menu). Fingers crossed for the property.

Adds the Only the Lonely storyline

This piece includes:

Three NPCs: one TFable male named Augustus Drake, one perma-preg shortstack feline female called Kathy, and one macro female tauress dubbed Ava.

One TF: A tauric macro and BBW lite TF with a dash of multi-boob that functions like the slutty/horny dragon infection given by Christy.

One new area: Located in the dry plains, The Last Chance motel is a fast travel point and home to this piece's three NPCs. To find it, the player must either start the unusual creature questline for Matt, or complete Mouseâs first quest if theyâre playing the forgotten scenario. Then they must search the Dry Plains for the event Only the Lonely. This is to prevent early game rushing for the pieceâs items and, or TF as well as ensuring the PC has a base understanding of the nanites.

Two new items: a gauss rifle thatâs meant to serve as an upgrade to the pistol but lacks the first strike function of Stripeâs old gun and an extremely nourishing TG milk item.

Changelog:

Adds the line ânow Only the Lonely is active;â to line 436 Main Storyline in Stripesâ folder and line 740 Hospital in Wahnâs folder.

Adds a modified version of âfelinoid cumâ to the alien felinoid loot entry on line 165 in Damagedâs file.

Added a 45% chance to loot felinoid cum from the alien felinoid see line 166 in Damagedâs file. I might lower the drop rate on this. However, I have less than fond memories of playing classic WoW and being told to collect ten bear hearts. Then spending the next ninety minutes of my life doing nothing but slaughtering bears who somehow donât have hearts.

Modified the felinoid cum desc and stats due to inform creating multiple linked versions of the item in the playerâs inventory. I donât know why the game needs me to do this, but the fix seems to hold, so here we are. See line 1962 cum items in âcore mechanicsâ for the change.

Included âmargay taur milkâ to line 4186 of the milk item list. Margay taur milk is essentially an estrogen pill plus food and water in milk form. It might need a nerf, but itâs super easy to negate the need for food and water in FS anyways.

Added âInclude Last_Chance_Map by Sundered Dragon.â to the locations section of story.ni on line 234.

Added âInclude Margay Taur by Sundered Dragon.â to the Monsters/Infections section of story.ni on line 594.

Added âInclude Augustus_Drake by Sundered Dragon.â to the NPC section of the story.ni line 758.

Added âInclude Ava by Sundered Dragon.â to the NPC section of the story.ni line 758.

Added âInclude Kathy by Sundered Dragon.â to the NPC section of the story.ni line 880.

Added Last Chance Parking Lot	"Last Chance Parking Lot"	"Last Chance Parking Lot"	"Dry Plains" to the Navigation file line 41 in core mechanics.

Reworks The Visuals Of Independent And Nanotrasen Captains (#2453)

<!-- Write **BELOW** The Headers and **ABOVE** The comments else it may
not be viewable. -->
<!-- You can view Contributing.MD for a detailed description of the pull
request process. -->

Does what it says in the title. This is a demented PR that touches a lot
of things, but its main benefit is that now regular independent
captains, cowboy independent captains, and nanotrasen captains have a
unique identity.

Of those changed, it includes:

- The Nanotrasen Captain (parade)

![image](https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest/assets/77556824/48a31cb1-b266-43cb-9b6e-525028893011)

- The Nanotrasen Captain (regular)

- The Independent Captain (regular/parade)

![image](https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest/assets/77556824/17ecb3d3-5f2f-4ce0-a518-81366945ebdf)

- The Independent Captain (western)

![image](https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest/assets/77556824/a56a798c-5adf-41d7-917a-730661f306ed)

The PR also axes a bunch of unused, or frankly quite basic lieutenant
outfits that were nothing more than set dressing with not much substance
behind them. The roles were not removed for now, and they have
appropriate outfits as a placeholder pending a full removal.

This also means that the Head of Personnel was slightly touched up,
mostly by having a coat and hat similar to the western captain's when
appropriate. The role itself is pending a full visual rework for later
that is beyond the scope of this PR.

Speaking of removals, this also means that captain outfits/roles that
were there as a legacy of removed ships, were finally axed for good.
Goodbye deserter captain for Riggs variant number 4, you will not be
missed.

This PR also touches several (a lot) of maps, mostly adding/removing
outfits that were either missing, or didn't fit with the dress code of
the vessel.

Also the PR fixes an oversight by @MarkSuckerberg by making the BYOND
version warning an actual warning, instead of an error when compiling.
Etto bleh.
<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is

Visual cohesion is important, and dear fucking god if I see one more
independent western captain not wearing the duster because it wasn't in
the ship, I will weep, and my weeping will cause a biblical deluge.

Bugfixes and Expansionism Boost

Feature Updates:
- Doubled damage dealt by Vinerva's "Thorn Wall" property.
- If the Expansionism tenet is fully elder aligned (-2), orc hordes, spelltwister hordes, and orc corsairs will build new camps using the "Build Camp" ritual, if they find themselves in a valid location, such as after completely razing an enemy settlement, and there are no armies for them to attack instead. If the orc society has a shipyard, this will allow them to build on disconnected coastlines.

Bugfixes:
- The power's gained from Vinerva's god specific tenet now properly check if they are within range of a heart of the forest.
- Vinera's "Sapling of Life" power now checks against all waystations in each neighbouring location instead of only the first.
- Vinerva's "Sapling of Life" power must now be adjacent to an orc camp or waystation of a valid culture, not just next to orc territory of a valid culture.
- Fixed collection modified error that occurs when Vinerva's "Thorn Wall" property kills an army.
- A location with an Orchard of Life is no longer a valid target for the "Sapling of Life" power.
- The "Build Camp" ritual is now only valid if neighbouring an orc camp or waystaion of a matching orc society, instead of simply needing to be neighbouring the matching orc society.

Improves the deployable component (#79199)

## About The Pull Request

The deployable component had a few random things I noticed when I tried
actually using it that kinda sucked so I'm:

Making the examine message more generic, we did NOT need to make it that
complicated.
Letting anything with hands deploy stuff, because mobs other than humans
can hold things.
Giving the option to let something be deployed more than once.
Letting direction setting be optional.
Tweaking the check for if something can be placed somewhere to be a bit
better.
## Why It's Good For The Game

I want to use the deployable component for stuff but I made it awful.
## Changelog
:cl:
code: the deployable component has been tweaked and improved with some
new options to it

Adds support to the wet_floor component to avoid displaying its overlay, makes ice turfs no longer receive said wet overlay (#79275)

## About The Pull Request
The title says it all, really.

I always thought ice looked a bit silly, and always wondered why. Today,
I found out it was because of the `wet_floor` component adding an
overlay that suddenly made a turf that should look continuous, tiled,
which in turn gave some very ugly visuals. Ice already looks slippery,
you can tell that it's ice, and the overlay that was added to it just
didn't really help telegraph that any better than the sprite itself
already does.

That's why I added support to make it so it would be possible to force
the overlay to just not be applied to the turf that's affected by the
component, to make it all look a bit better overall.

I added it to the ice turfs as a proof of concept, although I guess it
could also be used on other turfs that are always "wet", like the
bananium floors, but I didn't really care enough to touch that yet, and
I guess the bananium floors can use it a bit better than ice did.

I did notice in this PR that the smoothing of ice seemed to potentially
be broken, but that's something to look into at a later time.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Look at this ice and how much smoother it looks like now:

## Changelog

:cl: GoldenAlpharex
code: Added support to the wet_floor component to make it so the wet
overlay could not be applied to certain turfs if desired.
fix: Ice turfs no longer look tiled, and instead look smooth when placed
next to one-another.

[MIRROR] Fixes Space Dragon Attacking [MDB IGNORE] (#24315)

* Fixes Space Dragon Attacking (#78964)

Fixes #78953

## About The Pull Request

Basically the gist is that Space Dragon's special attack code was on
`AttackingTarget()` rather than whatever the hell simple animals
controlled by clients use (I didn't bother enough to look into the chain
to remember this). This was the complete wrong proc to use, and it NEVER
got executed. Anyways, we just hook into the signal for whatever the
simple animal proc is as well as clean up all the code, make everything
pretty, and most importantly:

MAKE THE DAMN CODE WORK
## Why It's Good For The Game

Either someone did not test their code at all, or some weird esoteric
change in the attack chain changed this somehow? I'm not sure when or
why this happened but it is guaranteed to be fixed now.

The code cleanup and tinkering I did means that it's gonna be about 10%
easier to port this over to a basic mob eventually (not doing a full
refactor when this shit is this broken, the code added here is modular
enough to the point where it's plug-n-play).
## Changelog
:cl:
fix: Space Dragons can now, once again, tear down walls and eat corpses.
They also have regained their special damage modifier when attacking
mechs.

new space ruin, the biological research outpost (#79149)

## About The Pull Request

![2023-10-21 18 02

adds this ruin to space ruin pool
this is a shady (as NT always is) bioresearch outpost that got fucked up
by an experiment
this has like some puzzle aspect to it since you gotta find keycards and
shit and press buttons to unlock shield gates
this ends with you fighting a heart which if you defeat, destroys the
blockade that prevents you from entering the outpost vault

also you can no longer literally just cut indestructible grilles or
unanchor indestructible windows

### new puzzle elements or something idk
variant of pressure plate that you cannot remove and it sends a puzzle
signal
cooler red puzzle doors that look very foreboding or something idk
theyre for this ruin
also puzzle blockades, which are indestructible dense objects that are
destroyed if they receive a puzzle signal
and also buttons and keycard pads for puzzles


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/c98807ec-1e7b-49c4-a757-cdbb76a1b566



https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/9d5d9dd1-5868-44e6-a978-5ea57b30c298

stuff that throws electric shocks in a pattern, ignores insuls and only
knocks down, and no you cannot just run past


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/5772917c-a963-48a4-a743-b0f610801d25

### enemies
living floor, it can only attack stuff on top of it and it attacks until
the victim is dead
it is invincible to all but a crowbar, and it cannot move, and it
remains hidden until a victim is in range


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/aa1d54f6-b259-4e58-9d44-e393d2131acf

living flesh, it can replace your limbs with itself
the conditions for that are; the limb must have 20 or more brute, victim
must be alive and dismemberable, the limb may not be torso or head, or
the limb may not be living flesh
alternatively it can replace a missing limb
these are all checked with every attack
they have 20 hp
the limbs in question will sometimes act up, while passively draining
nutrition, arms will randomly start pulling nearby stuff, legs may step
randomly
limbs when detached, turn into mobs and reactivate AI 2 seconds later.
if the host is shocked, all living flesh limbs will detach, or if the
host dies they will also do that


https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/70376633/765cc99e-c800-4efb-aabe-d68817bbd7ae



## Why It's Good For The Game

ruin variety is cool i think
also the other things i added should be useful for other mappers for
bitrunning or whatever

also bug bad for that one fix
## Changelog
:cl:
add: living floor, living flesh, and other stuff for the bioresearch
outpost ruin
add: bioresearch outpost ruin
fix: you may not defeat indestructible grilles and windows with mere
tools

Basic Pirate NPCs (#79284)

## About The Pull Request

Converts hostile pirate NPCs to basic mobs - specifically, a subtype of
trooper. As their behavior is not meaningfully distinct from other
troopers, this conversion mostly just sticks them on the existing AI
behavior while keeping the rest the same.

Pirates do have one new thing going for them, though, to differentiate
them from other troopers. They use the new **plundering attacks**
component, which means that every time they land a melee attack, they
steal money from the bank account of whoever they hit. This requires the
target to be wearing an ID with a linked bank account, so it's not the
hardest thing in the world to hide your money from them - but it's still
something to be wary of! If killed, any mob with this component will
drop everything they've stolen in a convenient holochip.
## Why It's Good For The Game

Takes down 5 more simplemobs, and (I think) converts the last remaining
trooper-type enemy to be a basic trooper. (It's possible there's more
I've forgotten that could use the same AI, though.)

The money-stealing behavior is mostly good because I think it's funny,
but it also makes the pirates something a little distinct from "yet
another mob that runs at you and punches you until you die". They still
do that, but now there's a little twist! This can be placed on other
mobs too, if we want to make any other sorts of thieves or brigands.
## Changelog
:cl:
refactor: Pirate NPCs now use the basic mob framework. They'll be a
little smarter in combat, and if you're wearing your ID they'll siphon
your bank account with every melee attack! Beware! Please report any
bugs.

"10:00 AM. https://youtu.be/DLjWM4-zQ5w?list=PL8JmJYDyXnXlrwJPh3ve11lxhNBXQGw64&t=1

I'll stop by watching Witch's Weapon here. My hand doesn't feel a bit better than yesterday, but I know not to trust it. If I start programming right now, it will all go to hell again.

I will move according to plan. An issue on the cursorless repo and ask whether there is a way to fine tune my voice. But I expect it will be difficult so. I almost likely just move to writing Heart's Desire for the next month or two until my hand recovers enough to program. So far there has been an update for the packaging in transit. The keyboard has moved to another facility.

I want for it to come here as soon as possible, but I need to look at it realistically, even if it got here to day, I still wouldn't be in good enough condition to make use of it. So it doesn't really matter whether it arrives next week or in two.

My main priority should be just to relax for the next month or so.

Now let me try out cursor less.

10:10 AM. It seems that today. saying cursorless cheat sheet and cursorless reference does in fact open the correct web page.

I have no idea why this didn't work for me last time.

I mean on one hand, it cannot possibly be the case that my diction improved so much in just a single day. But on another it also can't be the case that the program itself improved since I didn't update it.

Anyway, it doesn't seem like I'll need to open that issue that I can plant yesterday.

https://youtu.be/8SkdfdXWYaI

Let me match these videos, and then I will start writing. I honestly don't feel like me. I am messing with this **** even too. I got the cheat sheet to work somehow.

https://youtu.be/8SkdfdXWYaI?t=1378
> It works, the best for Lisps.

Yeah, this is one of the things that I've been afraid of. The Lisp is the language that I h'd most expect to be good for this kind of thing.

https://youtu.be/YKuRkGkf5HU?t=1144

Even without cursorless, Talon could be used to great effect for programming.

https://youtu.be/YKuRkGkf5HU?t=1459

The advice to dedicate some learning time to this is pretty good right now. Right now I don't really feel like it.

I'm starting to hear Thunder outside, so I might need to scram Well, it's true that I have that UPS. It won't protect me from a direct lightning strike.

But I'll wait for a bit longer before I run. Maybe I have time to finish the video.

https://youtu.be/YKuRkGkf5HU?t=1845

Never mind I have to run.

12:55 PM. Hey, I'm back. Let's assume the videos from before. The bad weather went away as soon as it started. I shouldn't have even shut down.

1:00 PM. It seems that the keyboard is at the international airport. I am tracking it online.

It's actually pretty great that it is being transmitted on Sunday. The Chinese sure are hard workers.

Since it is at an international airport in a few days, maybe even two it should arrive in Croatia and then I'll have to wait a few days after that for it to arrive at my doorstep via mail. It's possible that it might arrive next week near the end. Maybe on Thursday or Friday.

1:45 PM. Watching these videos is making me realize that I don't actually need a cursorless, just talon.

But I am going to do is aim to go halfway, then navigation is the most annoying part of using these programs. But if I could configure them to just input code, Then maybe I could have something serviceable..

Once I get the glove 80 keyboard, I'm going to be able to use the left side to navigate using the lower layer. I also have this track wall mouse on the right hand, which is easier to use than the old mouse. So using the keyboard and the mouse just for navigation and using my voice to input code could be a viable first step towards voice programming.

Let me continue watching the videos. I want to watch the mall. I shouldn't feel obligated to start writing heart's desire.

It feels like that Perixx 524 split keyboard really **** **** my shoulders.

It is a real mistake to go with that cheap model. It could have ordered the Glove80 a month ago and I would have already had it today.

Coding by Voice with Voice Attack: a Practical Guide for Programmers

This isn't about Talon, but about another program. It's called voice attack.

https://youtu.be/U-NZjzDj-Xk?t=759
> Speech recognition voice training...

It seems this is a feature of windows. I had no idea it existed.

https://youtu.be/U-NZjzDj-Xk?t=916
It seems this program is made in C# so it can run arbitrarily program and scripts made in it.

2:45 PM. Okay, what I'm going to do next is study up Talon. I want to decide whether I want to use Telon or voice attack. Talon also has a visual studio code extension. So I want to understand what its purpose is.

https://voiceattack.com/Default.aspx

I'm really going to try this out. The reason why I'm considering this, instead of Talon, is because Talon's voice recognition engine is worse than Windows' native one. And I also figured out just recently in that video that the Windows Voice Recognition engine can be fine tuned using my own voice.

3:35 PM. https://chaosparrot.github.io/talon_practice/
https://talon.wiki/

Yesterday I was overwhelmed by this, but now I feel like I am able to absorb it more readily.

https://talon.wiki/getting_started/

There is a section on improving voice recognition accuracy.

https://gaming.tobii.com/product/eye-tracker-5/

Admit I had no idea eye trackers even existed before today. I thought that eye tracking would be done using a camera yesterday.

https://youtu.be/aFN4HajMUPI
Tobii Eye Tracker 5 Review | Simple. Intuitive. Essential?

https://talon.wiki/talon_related_resources/

OK, I the videos and eye tracking were very interesting. Let's watch some of these.

Has been a long time since I spent the entire day studying just studying and researching things. Getting Rsi led to such new experiences.

Maybe I should resume posting these journal entries in the Spiral repo Github commits? Just so you know, I'm using Windows voice typing to generate this text. I have it remapped to the caps lock key. Usually windows typing is activated by pressing the windows, and then the H key, but I had a rema to the capsule key because the default is too hard to hit.

https://youtu.be/j70UOLVO4I4
9 windows settings every user should change now!

Forget this. I don't feel like watching this right now.

https://youtu.be/y0ls3lH3rYM
OpenAI's ChatGPT Fell For This Illusion! But Why?

And this two minute paper video is interesting.

The videos for tell on a voice that I watched today very informative. I think.they gave me a bit of courage to go forward with a learning such a tool. I'll simply have to dive in and get used to it. I'll give it a try. And if I cannot get the voice recognizer to mesh with my voice, I'll try the voice attack software.

The keyboard that I ordered has arrived at an international airport, but even.if it got here, I still wouldn't be able to use it because of the state of my right hand. So it will only really be useful to its full extent once I heal from my rsi.

5:30 PM. Forget this, Talon is horrible. It finds it really easy to misinterpret what I am saying.

5:35 PM. I am installing voice attack, and it's offering me right off the bat to help train the voice recognizer engine. This is something I'm really missing with Talon.

For an application such as this, the voice recognizer engine is the most important part of it. And not having it work in top shape is really a big problem with Talon.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMd2J1iNJCMeUcBmOjJAMb0o-3BClzOPt

I spent some time training Windows speech recognizer engine and. Now I need to figure out how I can use voice attack in order to dictate inputs the same way I'm doing for voice typing right here.

Maybe the easiest thing to do would be to just activate the voice typing feature of windows instead of messing with the detection feature of voice attack.

https://youtu.be/U-NZjzDj-Xk
Coding by Voice with Voice Attack: a Practical Guide for Programmers

Let me take a look at how this guy configured it for a bit more. I think in one of the parts of the video he flashed the dictation commands.

Arguably, it would, it would have been better to use Talon, but it's bad at recognizing my voice.

Actually these guys channel might be worth checking out. I'm interested in what he has to say about learning to program by gaming.

https://youtu.be/U-NZjzDj-Xk?t=345

Oh, I see what he is doing here. See, he's setting the clipboard to dictation and then pasting from it, I think.

Schillo and how you doing today
Schillo and how you doing today

killed world , you doing today
killed how you doing today than

Hello World, how are you doing today?
Hill world how are you doing today?
Hill world how are you doing today?
Hello World, how are you doing today?

kill the old filly doing today
kill the old filly doing today

OK, I figured out how to use the dictation feature of a voice attack and it's very bad, much worse than Talon.

The paragraph in the middle is actually done using voice typing, not using voice attack. But for some reason, you know, when I stop down, my voice is interprets. Hello world as Hillo World. And the hello world as kill world.

I was trying to dictate `Hello World. How are you doing today?` ...For all of the previous sentences.

I'm guessing that the difference is even though they are using the same speech recognition engine because the voice typing is using some kind of correction pass after this voice has been inputted.

And guess in that case, it doesn't mean that I have to favor voice attack over Talon.

7:25 PM. It seems either way, I'm going to have to forget about using either tailon or voice attack for dictation. If I'm going to use these programs, I'm going to have to accept their weaknesses as they are. So tomorrow, my mission will be to go through the basics of Talon.

I'm just about to gotten used to its alphabet. And now I have to get used to everything else. That simple tutorial I went through should, in fact, be enough to use it effectively. I just need to put in some practice.

If I can do this, then I will be able to resume programming.

I'll cut down the amount of text I have to write drastically.

The voice software, together with the ergonomic mouse and keyboard when it arrives, will be enough to make me a lot more efficient at producing text.

Right now, I'm going to call it a day. I'm just going to relax from here for real.

I'm going to post this journal style commit for a first time in almost since the start of the year."

#### Sunday 2023-11-12 18:52:17 by Chandler Carruth

Introduce two speed-of-light benchmarks. (#3270)

The goal of these kinds of benchmarks is to help calibrate other
benchmarks and expectations. They benchmark the underlying hardware
capabilities that we can't avoid, and help illustrate bounds for what is
possible. The term "speed-of-light benchmark" references the aspect of
measuring how fast thing could possible run.

The first is a simple memory bandwidth measurement in the best case
scenario -- using `strcpy` over the buffer. This still does a minimal
number of writes to memory and examines each byte of input to see if it
is null, but can cheat in every way possible to run at the maximum speed
of hardware. To a certain extent, we never expect to get close to this
speed, but it's a good illustration of how much headroom the hardware
has available.

The second is potentially more interesting. This illustrates how fast a
byte-by-byte dispatch loop can potentially be. It uses the technique
that I'm hoping to use in the lexer itself of guaranteed tail recursion
to achieve this with a very small code footprint. The performance of
this technique, even when running in this extremely minimal setting to
establish bounds, is hugely dependent on the number of distinct dispatch
targets, and so the benchmark includes a healthy range to show the range
of performance that we might expect when running in a byte-by-byte mode.
Note that we should expect the lexer to be *faster* than this
"speed-of-light" whenever it is able to lex in larger granules than
byte-wise. But for complex, dense token sequences that force looking at
every byte, this shows the "worst case" "speed-of-light" in a sense.

On my recent AMD cloud VM instance, I get the following results running
the main lexer benchmark with these changes included:

Even though we're not lexing anything in the speed-of-light benchmark,
the tokens-per-second measure is still meaningful because we *generated*
the token stream and know how many tokens we put into it. The dispatch
technique easily exceeds hits 10-million tokens/second, but we need to
do substantially better than that to lex at 10-million lines/second.
Fortunately, when the lexer is consuming more than one-byte tokens,
we're already faster than this. And the bytes-per-second numbers from
all but the worst case dispatch scenario are promising.

sched/core: Fix ttwu() race

Paul reported rcutorture occasionally hitting a NULL deref:

  sched_ttwu_pending()
    ttwu_do_wakeup()
      check_preempt_curr() := check_preempt_wakeup()
        find_matching_se()
          is_same_group()
            if (se->cfs_rq == pse->cfs_rq) <-- *BOOM*

Debugging showed that this only appears to happen when we take the new
code-path from commit:

  2ebb17717550 ("sched/core: Offload wakee task activation if it the wakee is descheduling")

and only when @cpu == smp_processor_id(). Something which should not
be possible, because p->on_cpu can only be true for remote tasks.
Similarly, without the new code-path from commit:

  c6e7bd7afaeb ("sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu")

this would've unconditionally hit:

  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL);

and if: 'cpu == smp_processor_id() && p->on_cpu' is possible, this
would result in an instant live-lock (with IRQs disabled), something
that hasn't been reported.

The NULL deref can be explained however if the task_cpu(p) load at the
beginning of try_to_wake_up() returns an old value, and this old value
happens to be smp_processor_id(). Further assume that the p->on_cpu
load accurately returns 1, it really is still running, just not here.

Then, when we enqueue the task locally, we can crash in exactly the
observed manner because p->se.cfs_rq != rq->cfs_rq, because p's cfs_rq
is from the wrong CPU, therefore we'll iterate into the non-existant
parents and NULL deref.

The closest semi-plausible scenario I've managed to contrive is
somewhat elaborate (then again, actual reproduction takes many CPU
hours of rcutorture, so it can't be anything obvious):

					X->cpu = 1
					rq(1)->curr = X

	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2

					// switch away from X
					LOCK rq(1)->lock
					smp_mb__after_spinlock
					dequeue_task(X)
					  X->on_rq = 9
					switch_to(Z)
					  X->on_cpu = 0
					UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									// migrate X to cpu 0
									LOCK rq(1)->lock
									dequeue_task(X)
									set_task_cpu(X, 0)
									  X->cpu = 0
									UNLOCK rq(1)->lock

									LOCK rq(0)->lock
									enqueue_task(X)
									  X->on_rq = 1
									UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// switch to X
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	switch_to(X)
	  X->on_cpu = 1
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

	// X goes sleep
	X->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	smp_mb();			// wake X
					ttwu()
					  LOCK X->pi_lock
					  smp_mb__after_spinlock

					  if (p->state)

					  cpu = X->cpu; // =? 1

					  smp_rmb()

	// X calls schedule()
	LOCK rq(0)->lock
	smp_mb__after_spinlock
	dequeue_task(X)
	  X->on_rq = 0

					  if (p->on_rq)

					  smp_rmb();

					  if (p->on_cpu && ttwu_queue_wakelist(..)) [*]

					  smp_cond_load_acquire(&p->on_cpu, !VAL)

					  cpu = select_task_rq(X, X->wake_cpu, ...)
					  if (X->cpu != cpu)
	switch_to(Y)
	  X->on_cpu = 0
	UNLOCK rq(0)->lock

However I'm having trouble convincing myself that's actually possible
on x86_64 -- after all, every LOCK implies an smp_mb() there, so if ttwu
observes ->state != RUNNING, it must also observe ->cpu != 1.

(Most of the previous ttwu() races were found on very large PowerPC)

Nevertheless, this fully explains the observed failure case.

Fix it by ordering the task_cpu(p) load after the p->on_cpu load,
which is easy since nothing actually uses @cpu before this.

The Brawlening: Unarmed fighting interactions for shoving, grabbing and nonlethal takedowns (not martial arts) (#79362)

## About The Pull Request

I've tweaked some elements of unarmed fighting to give it additional
interactions between the various components, bridging them into a more
coherent system and focusing more strongly as tool for disabling
opponents nonlethally.

### Shoving

Shoving guarantees that unarmed attacks will land while knocked
off-balance (AKA when slowed by a shove).

Being off-balance means that you can be knocked down from a punch if you
have taken enough brute and stamina damage combined (at least above 40).

Being off-balance makes you vulnerable to grabs while you have a
moderate amount of stamina damage (30 damage), forcing you to have to
resist even passive grabs. This pairs _exceptionally_ well with
tackling.

### Grappling

Grappling someone makes your unarmed attacks penetrate armor based on a
new limb value called ``unarmed_effectiveness``. This is something
shared by kicking.

### Unarmed Attacks in General

``unarmed_effectiveness`` has also taken over the functionality of
``unarmed_stun_threshold``, as well as accuracy calculations. Human
equivalent limbs (pretty much all of them except mushrooms and golems)
have a value of 10.

Now, ``unarmed_effectiveness`` determines how accurately a given limb
makes unarmed attacks. Unarmed attacks have a base inaccuracy of 20%,
with effectiveness acting as a reduction to this value. (so for humans,
that's 20% - 10% before any value changes from brute and stamina
damage). It is also capped at 75% miss chance, just to avoid those weird
instances of two brawling fighters being incapable of finishing each
other off at a certain amount of damage and it being real awkward, like
it does currently.

It also determines the base probability of landing a knockdown punch.
For humans, this is 10%.

For the most part, these two particular changes are roughly equivalent
to the current values, just handled in a way that is more
straightforward to understand from a code perspective.

In addition to the above, human equivalent limbs have higher damage
floors for unarmed attacks. Arms deal 5-10 damage, while legs deal 7-15
damage. In addition, kicks also deal stamina damage, like punches do.

### Minor Mentions

Golems and Mushroom People (who don't even use their limbs for their
unarmed strikes because mushroom people start with a martial art) have
very accurate punches, and their punches penetrate quite a bit of armor
when they are entitled to that. They also have a high knockdown
probability. This is partially because they previously already _had_
these features due to the wonky math at play, but also because this is
their big thing they are good at.

Carp mutation also got a big win out of this as well. If and when you
actually manage to get that to work and matter.

## Why It's Good For The Game

My favorite thing in this game is the robustness of unarmed fighting.
It's the part of the game that actually acknowledges the sandbox and
environmental interaction in a big way. The only problem with the
unarmed combat is that it is a bit disjointed, and often much weaker
than using even the most pathetic weapon you can get your hands on
unless you're using the stun loops available. Those loops get a bit
boring, even if they're mostly all environmental (except for the lucky
neckgrab finish). Giving more options generally means that even when not
in an ideal position, you still have _some_ options.

It also has some internal inconsistencies in design even in the same
proc, like accuracy calculations and knockdowns, as well as weird splits
in damage. So I decided to resolve that.

Now, every part of unarmed fighting has some relevance in the other
parts. Predominantly, it is heavily favoured towards dealing stamina
damage, making unarmed combat very favourable as a nonlethal method of
taking someone down, which is something we currently lack considerably.
While people may still opt to simply beat someone into actual crit
rather than stop at stamina crit, the possibility is actually entirely
available and supported now. No just banking on a lucky neckgrab after a
shove.

Paying attention to damage dealt and thinking intelligently about how
you apply combinations of effects allows even someone on the significant
back foot an opportunity for a comeback if they know what they're doing
against even armed opponents.

Separating accuracy and knockdown effectiveness from damage allows for
more consistent design and readability, but also preventing weirdness
ike tighter damage spreads increasing knockdown probabilities as well as
increasing accuracy without the coder knowing why. This also lets us
make unarmed attacks just that little bit stronger. Since unarmed
attacks require more complicated combinations to work, I think this
won't make them stronger than weapons necessarily, but it will make for
more interesting swung fights.

## Changelog
:cl:
add: With the flood of Chi within the Spinward Sector receding, various
masters of The Tunnel Arts, colloquially known as 'Maint-fu Masters',
have started to refine the basics of their martial techniques. New forms
have started to develop within Spacestation 13's hidden maintenance
dojos.
add: Someone shoved off-balance makes them vulnerable to more guaranteed
unarmed strikes, knockdowns from a successful punch, and more difficult
to escape grabs.
add: Grabbing someone (as well as kicking them while they're on the
floor) makes them more vulnerable to taking unarmed attack damage, even
if they have armor.
balance: Unarmed strikes made with human-equivalent limbs have higher
damage floors, meaning you overall do more damage on average while not
increasing the overall damage potential. It's more consistent!
refactor: Significantly changed how punching accuracy and knockdowns are
calculated.
balance: Golem and mushroom limbs are a lot more effective at punching
as a result of these various changes. As they should be.

Adds Paddy, the Security Mech (#79376)

## About The Pull Request
- Adds a new combat mech, Paddy. Paddy is a modified Ripley MK-I,
intended for use by the station's security force. Like the MK-I, the
Paddy features an open-air cockpit design (and thus does not protect
from ranged weapons), but maintains the speed of the base unit.
Constructing a Paddy is similar to constructing a MK-II, though the kit
requires combat-mech level research. Sprites by
[DrDiasyl](https://github.com/DrDiasyl)
-- The paddy has an internal cargo bay capable of holding up to four
individuals (loaded with a hydraulic claw). If the pilot exits the
Paddy, any loaded individuals are likewise ejected. Individuals can
attempt to resist their way out of the mech, but it requires the mech to
be stationary for 45 seconds. If they do this, all individuals in the
holding cell are ejected.

- Adds a new mech equipment piece, the hydraulic claw. Similar to a
clamp, this Paddy-exclusive item can load mobs into the Paddy's cargo
bay. Humanoid mobs are handcuffed upon loading. The hydraulic claw is
unlocked on the same tech node as the Paddy.

- Adds a round-start Paddy, carrying one peacekeeper disabler and one
hydraulic claw, to each security area on all maps. Round-start Paddys
are also pre-locked with security access. Security now has access to a
mech charger, and a small bay for it all. Map edits were done by
[Maurukas](https://github.com/Maurukas).

- Also did some minor cleanup of various mech-related code. Ripley mech
cargo is no longer stored in the mech, but within the "ejector" object.
This doesn't have any player-facing changes, but it is easier to
organize behind the scenes. additionally, if Ripleys are destroyed now,
they drop their stored objects rather than deleting them.

## Why It's Good For The Game
Playing lone security is probably one of the least fun aspects of the
game. Arresting any assistant is inevitably setting yourself up against
the tide as a whole; You try to stun any one person and they crawl out
of the woodworks to get in your way, drag off the arrestee, and probably
try to steal your gear.

The Paddy is set up to be functional against low-threat targets, but not
particularly good against anything with purpose. The round-start Paddy
carries the disabler equipment, as well as the law claw, to detain
individuals in a *somewhat* safe manner. Being that you're inside an
exosuit, you're immune to shovespam that plagues the halls, and you
don't risk dropping important gear quite as easily.

However, The open canopy gives you no protection at all from ranged
attacks, nor from atmos hazards. Being that you're in an exosuit, you
cannot use other items or equipment. The AI will have trouble finding
you to open a door, due to your name not jumping their camera to your
location.
## Changelog
:cl: Zxaber, DrDiasyl, Maurukas
add: A new security-focused combat mech, the Paddy, has been added,
intended to be particularly helpful for lone sec officers. You will find
one in the Security main office, and a replacement can be built with
late-game mech research.
fix: Ripley MK-I and MK-II mechs no longer qdel their stored items when
destroyed.

Add Server Context deprecation warning (#27424)

As agreed, we're removing Server Context. This was never official
documented.

We've found that it's not that useful in practice. Often the better
options are:

- Read things off the url or global scope like params or cookies.
- Use the module system for global dependency injection.
- Use `React.cache()` to dedupe multiple things instead of computing
once and passing down.

There are still legit use cases for Server Context but you have to be
very careful not to pass any large data, so in generally we recommend
against it anyway.

Yes, prop drilling is annoying but it's not impossible for the cases
this is needed. I would personally always pick it over Server Context
anyway.

Semantically, Server Context also blocks object deduping due to how it
plays out with Server Components that can't be deduped. This is much
more important feature.

Since it's already in canary along with the rest of RSC, we're adding a
warning for a few versions before removing completely to help migration.

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is
documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from
merging your PR! -->

## Why It's Good For The Game

With the recent repair of the previous songs in the Jukebox, it would
seem to be a good idea to finally add more to the list, allowing for
more songs for players to choose from.


<!-- Argue for the merits of your changes and how they benefit the game,
especially if they are controversial and/or far reaching. If you can't
actually explain WHY what you are doing will improve the game, then it
probably isn't good for the game in the first place. -->

## Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely
observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change
does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly
mark your PRs to prevent unnecessary GBP loss. You can read up on GBP
and it's effects on PRs in the tgstation guides for contributors. Please
note that maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags
should they deem it appropriate. You can attempt to finagle the system
all you want, but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off
the bat. -->

:cl:
add: Added more songs to the Jukebox!
/:cl:

<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put
your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your
GitHub username as author ingame. -->
<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the
icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags,
changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by
the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->

rerun dict fixer, except instead of painstakingly going through

and reverting the unnecessary changes, this time keep all of them
since apparently numpy can't handle dict views so what fucking
ever just convert everything to lists. This is so fucking stupid.

Makes the Regal Condor realistically simulate being shot dead with a high caliber hand cannon by making it HITSCAN (#78674)

## About The Pull Request

The Regal Condor come with a magazine and ammo already inside.

The recipe for the magazine now no longer needs TC, but does need donk
pockets (sponsored murder gear, you see) and a hell of a lot more
materials per magazine (you're looking at like 40 sheets of various
materials all up). It also needs you to make the Condor first. But it
comes preloaded with ammo.

The Condor is 1 whole TC more expensive. Also needs some metal. The old
recipe is there in spirit.

The Regal Condor and the magazines come with 10mm Reaper bullets.
They're high damage. They're high AP. They are also hitscan.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Apparently people don't like the Condor. Too much effort for not enough
reward. After all, revolvers exist. 'It must be a joke' they say! 'It's
joke content! I went to all that effort to make it for nothing! That
slut Anne tricked us!'

**Wrong, bitch.**

If you want the Condor to make you shit yourself the moment someone with
it appears on the screen, then fine!

### **You get what you fucking deserve.**

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Despite earlier reports suggesting that the famous lethality of
the Regal Condor was largely a myth, there has been rumors that the gun
has once again started to display its true killing potential on any
station that it 'manifests'.
